<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>EDITOR&rsquo;S INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Henry Mackenzie</span>, the son of an
Edinburgh physician, was born in August, 1745.&nbsp; After
education in the University of Edinburgh he went to London in
1765, at the age of twenty, for law studies, returned to
Edinburgh, and became Crown Attorney in the Scottish Court of
Exchequer.&nbsp; When Mackenzie was in London, Sterne&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Tristram Shandy&rdquo; was in course of publication.&nbsp;
The first two volumes had appeared in 1759, and the ninth
appeared in 1767, followed in 1768, the year of Sterne&rsquo;s
death, by &ldquo;The Sentimental Journey.&rdquo;&nbsp; Young
Mackenzie had a strong bent towards literature, and while
studying law in London, he read Sterne, and falling in with the
tone of sentiment which Sterne himself caught from the spirit of
the time and the example of Rousseau, he wrote &ldquo;The Man of
Feeling.&rdquo;&nbsp; This book was published, without
author&rsquo;s name, in 1771.&nbsp; It was so <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>popular that
a young clergyman made a copy of it popular with imagined
passages of erasure and correction, on the strength of which he
claimed to be its author, and obliged Henry Mackenzie to declare
himself.&nbsp; In 1773 Mackenzie published a second novel,
&ldquo;The Man of the World,&rdquo; and in 1777 a third,
&ldquo;Julia de Roubign&eacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; An essay-reading
society in Edinburgh, of which he was a leader, started in
January, 1779, a weekly paper called <i>The Mirror</i>, which he
edited until May, 1780.&nbsp; Its writers afterwards joined in
producing <i>The Lounger</i>, which lasted from February, 1785,
to January, 1787.&nbsp; Henry Mackenzie contributed forty-two
papers to <i>The Mirror</i> and fifty-seven to <i>The
Lounger</i>.&nbsp; When the Royal Society of Edinburgh was
founded Henry Mackenzie was active as one of its first
members.&nbsp; He was also one of the founders of the Highland
Society.</p>
<p>Although his &ldquo;Man of Feeling&rdquo; was a serious
reflection of the false sentiment of the Revolution, Mackenzie
joined afterwards in writing tracts to dissuade the people from
faith in the doctrines of the Revolutionists.&nbsp; Mackenzie
wrote also a tragedy, &ldquo;The Prince of Tunis,&rdquo; which
was acted with success at Edinburgh, and a comedy, &ldquo;The <a
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>White
Hypocrite,&rdquo; which was acted once only at Covent
garden.&nbsp; He died at the age of eighty-six, on the 13th June,
1831, having for many years been regarded as an elder friend of
their own craft by the men of letters who in his days gave
dignity to Edinburgh society, and caused the town to be called
the Modern Athens.</p>
<p>A man of refined taste, who caught the tone of the French
sentiment of his time, has, of course, pleased French critics,
and has been translated into French.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Man of
Feeling&rdquo; begins with imitation of Sterne, and proceeds in
due course through so many tears that it is hardly to be called a
dry book.&nbsp; As guide to persons of a calculating disposition
who may read these pages I append an index to the Tears shed in
&ldquo;The Man of Feeling.&rdquo;</p>

ix</span>AUTHOR&rsquo;S INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> dog had made a point on a piece
of fallow-ground, and led the curate and me two or three hundred
yards over that and some stubble adjoining, in a breathless state
of expectation, on a burning first of September.</p>
<p>It was a false point, and our labour was vain: yet, to do
Rover justice (for he&rsquo;s an excellent dog, though I have
lost his pedigree), the fault was none of his, the birds were
gone: the curate showed me the spot where they had lain basking,
at the root of an old hedge.</p>
<p>I stopped and cried Hem!&nbsp; The curate is fatter than I; he
wiped the sweat from his brow.</p>
<p>There is no state where one is apter to pause and look round
one, than after such a disappointment.&nbsp; It is even so in
life.&nbsp; When we have been hurrying on, impelled by some warm
wish or other, looking neither to the right hand nor to the <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>left&mdash;we
find of a sudden that all our gay hopes are flown; and the only
slender consolation that some friend can give us, is to point
where they were once to be found.&nbsp; And lo! if we are not of
that combustible race, who will rather beat their heads in spite,
than wipe their brows with the curate, we look round and say,
with the nauseated listlessness of the king of Israel, &ldquo;All
is vanity and vexation of spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked round with some such grave apophthegm in my mind when
I discovered, for the first time, a venerable pile, to which the
enclosure belonged.&nbsp; An air of melancholy hung about
it.&nbsp; There was a languid stillness in the day, and a single
crow, that perched on an old tree by the side of the gate, seemed
to delight in the echo of its own croaking.</p>
<p>I leaned on my gun and looked; but I had not breath enough to
ask the curate a question.&nbsp; I observed carving on the bark
of some of the trees: &rsquo;twas indeed the only mark of human
art about the place, except that some branches appeared to have
been lopped, to give a view of the cascade, which was formed by a
little rill at some distance.</p>
<p>Just at that instant I saw pass between the <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>trees a young
lady with a book in her hand.&nbsp; I stood upon a stone to
observe her; but the curate sat him down on the grass, and
leaning his back where I stood, told me, &ldquo;That was the
daughter of a neighbouring gentleman of the name of <span
class="smcap">Walton</span>, whom he had seen walking there more
than once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one <span
class="smcap">Harley</span> lived there, a whimsical sort of man
I am told, but I was not then in the cure; though, if I had a
turn for those things, I might know a good deal of his history,
for the greatest part of it is still in my possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His history!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, you may
call it what you please,&rdquo; said the curate; for indeed it is
no more a history than it is a sermon.&nbsp; The way I came by it
was this: some time ago, a grave, oddish kind of a man boarded at
a farmer&rsquo;s in this parish: the country people called him
The Ghost; and he was known by the slouch in his gait, and the
length of his stride.&nbsp; I was but little acquainted with him,
for he never frequented any of the clubs hereabouts.&nbsp; Yet
for all he used to walk a-nights, he was as gentle as a lamb at
times; for I have seen him playing at teetotum with the <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>children,
on the great stone at the door of our churchyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after I was made curate, he left the parish, and
went nobody knows whither; and in his room was found a bundle of
papers, which was brought to me by his landlord.&nbsp; I began to
read them, but I soon grew weary of the task; for, besides that
the hand is intolerably bad, I could never find the author in one
strain for two chapters together; and I don&rsquo;t believe
there&rsquo;s a single syllogism from beginning to
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to see this medley,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall see it now,&rdquo; answered the curate,
&ldquo;for I always take it along with me
a-shooting.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How came it so torn?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis excellent wadding,&rdquo; said the
curate.&mdash;This was a plea of expediency I was not in a
condition to answer; for I had actually in my pocket great part
of an edition of one of the German Illustrissimi, for the very
same purpose.&nbsp; We exchanged books; and by that means (for
the curate was a strenuous logician) we probably saved both.</p>
<p>When I returned to town, I had leisure to peruse the
acquisition I had made: I found it a bundle of little episodes,
put together without art, <a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>and of no importance on the whole,
with something of nature, and little else in them.&nbsp; I was a
good deal affected with some very trifling passages in it; and
had the name of Marmontel, or a Richardson, been on the
title-page&mdash;&rsquo;tis odds that I should have wept: But</p>
<p>One is ashamed to be pleased with the works of one knows not
whom.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">ON BASHFULNESS.&mdash;A
CHARACTER.&mdash;HIS OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is some rust about every man
at the beginning; though in some nations (among the French for
instance) the ideas of the inhabitants, from climate, or what
other cause you will, are so vivacious, so eternally on the wing,
that they must, even in small societies, have a frequent
collision; the rust therefore will wear off sooner: but in
Britain it often goes with a man to his grave; nay, he dares not
even pen a <i>hic jacet</i> to speak out for him after his
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them rub it off by travel,&rdquo; said the
baronet&rsquo;s <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>brother, who was a striking instance of excellent metal,
shamefully rusted.&nbsp; I had drawn my chair near his.&nbsp; Let
me paint the honest old man: &rsquo;tis but one passing sentence
to preserve his image in my mind.</p>
<p>He sat in his usual attitude, with his elbow rested on his
knee, and his fingers pressed on his cheek.&nbsp; His face was
shaded by his hand; yet it was a face that might once have been
well accounted handsome; its features were manly and striking, a
dignity resided on his eyebrows, which were the largest I
remember to have seen.&nbsp; His person was tall and well-made;
but the indolence of his nature had now inclined it to
corpulency.</p>
<p>His remarks were few, and made only to his familiar friends;
but they were such as the world might have heard with veneration:
and his heart, uncorrupted by its ways, was ever warm in the
cause of virtue and his friends.</p>
<p>He is now forgotten and gone!&nbsp; The last time I was at
Silton Hall, I saw his chair stand in its corner by the
fire-side; there was an additional cushion on it, and it was
occupied by my young lady&rsquo;s favourite lap dog.&nbsp; I drew
near unperceived, <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>and pinched its ears in the bitterness of my soul; the
creature howled, and ran to its mistress.&nbsp; She did not
suspect the author of its misfortune, but she bewailed it in the
most pathetic terms; and kissing its lips, laid it gently on her
lap, and covered it with a cambric handkerchief.&nbsp; I sat in
my old friend&rsquo;s seat; I heard the roar of mirth and gaiety
around me: poor Ben Silton!&nbsp; I gave thee a tear then: accept
of one cordial drop that falls to thy memory now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should wear it off by travel.&rdquo;&mdash;Why, it
is true, said I, that will go far; but then it will often happen,
that in the velocity of a modern tour, and amidst the materials
through which it is commonly made, the friction is so violent,
that not only the rust, but the metal too, is lost in the
progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me leave to correct the expression of your
metaphor,&rdquo; said Mr. Silton: &ldquo;that is not always rust
which is acquired by the inactivity of the body on which it
preys; such, perhaps, is the case with me, though indeed I was
never cleared from my youth; but (taking it in its first stage)
it is rather an encrustation, which nature has given for purposes
of the greatest wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;and
sometimes, like certain precious fossils, there may be hid under
it gems of the purest brilliancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, farther,&rdquo; continued Mr. Silton, &ldquo;there
are two distinct sorts of what we call bashfulness; this, the
awkwardness of a booby, which a few steps into the world will
convert into the pertness of a coxcomb; that, a consciousness,
which the most delicate feelings produce, and the most extensive
knowledge cannot always remove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the incidents I have already related, I imagine it will
be concluded that Harley was of the latter species of bashful
animals; at least, if Mr. Silton&rsquo;s principle is just, it
may be argued on this side; for the gradation of the first
mentioned sort, it is certain, he never attained.&nbsp; Some part
of his external appearance was modelled from the company of those
gentlemen, whom the antiquity of a family, now possessed of bare
&pound;250 a year, entitled its representative to approach: these
indeed were not many; great part of the property in his
neighbourhood being in the hands of merchants, who had got rich
by their lawful calling abroad, and the sons of stewards, who had
got rich by their lawful calling at home: persons so perfectly
versed <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>in
the ceremonial of thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of
thousands (whose degrees of precedency are plainly demonstrable
from the first page of the Complete Accomptant, or Young
Man&rsquo;s Best Pocket Companion) that a bow at church from them
to such a man as Harley would have made the parson look back into
his sermon for some precept of Christian humility.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF WORLDLY INTERESTS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are certain interests which
the world supposes every man to have, and which therefore are
properly enough termed worldly; but the world is apt to make an
erroneous estimate: ignorant of the dispositions which constitute
our happiness or misery, they bring to an undistinguished scale
the means of the one, as connected with power, wealth, or
grandeur, and of the other with their contraries.&nbsp;
Philosophers and poets have often protested against this
decision; but their arguments have <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>been despised as declamatory, or
ridiculed as romantic.</p>
<p>There are never wanting to a young man some grave and prudent
friends to set him right in this particular, if he need it; to
watch his ideas as they arise, and point them to those objects
which a wise man should never forget.</p>
<p>Harley did not want for some monitors of this sort.&nbsp; He
was frequently told of men whose fortunes enabled them to command
all the luxuries of life, whose fortunes were of their own
acquirement: his envy was invited by a description of their
happiness, and his emulation by a recital of the means which had
procured it.</p>
<p>Harley was apt to hear those lectures with indifference; nay,
sometimes they got the better of his temper; and as the instances
were not always amiable, provoked, on his part, some reflections,
which I am persuaded his good-nature would else have avoided.</p>
<p>Indeed, I have observed one ingredient, somewhat necessary in
a man&rsquo;s composition towards happiness, which people of
feeling would do well to acquire; a certain respect for the
follies of mankind: for there are so many fools whom the <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>opinion of
the world entitles to regard, whom accident has placed in heights
of which they are unworthy, that he who cannot restrain his
contempt or indignation at the sight will be too often
quarrelling with the disposal of things to relish that share
which is allotted to himself.&nbsp; I do not mean, however, to
insinuate this to have been the case with Harley; on the
contrary, if we might rely on his own testimony, the conceptions
he had of pomp and grandeur served to endear the state which
Providence had assigned him.</p>
<p>He lost his father, the last surviving of his parents, as I
have already related, when he was a boy.&nbsp; The good man, from
a fear of offending, as well as a regard to his son, had named
him a variety of guardians; one consequence of which was, that
they seldom met at all to consider the affairs of their ward; and
when they did meet, their opinions were so opposite, that the
only possible method of conciliation was the mediatory power of a
dinner and a bottle, which commonly interrupted, not ended, the
dispute; and after that interruption ceased, left the consulting
parties in a condition not very proper for adjusting it.&nbsp;
His education therefore had been but indifferently attended to;
and <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>after
being taken from a country school, at which he had been boarded,
the young gentleman was suffered to be his own master in the
subsequent branches of literature, with some assistance from the
parson of the parish in languages and philosophy, and from the
exciseman in arithmetic and book-keeping.&nbsp; One of his
guardians, indeed, who, in his youth, had been an inhabitant of
the Temple, set him to read Coke upon Lyttelton: a book which is
very properly put into the hands of beginners in that science, as
its simplicity is accommodated to their understandings, and its
size to their inclination.&nbsp; He profited but little by the
perusal; but it was not without its use in the family: for his
maiden aunt applied it commonly to the laudable purpose of
pressing her rebellious linens to the folds she had allotted
them.</p>
<p>There were particularly two ways of increasing his fortune,
which might have occurred to people of less foresight than the
counsellors we have mentioned.&nbsp; One of these was, the
prospect of his succeeding to an old lady, a distant relation,
who was known to be possessed of a very large sum in the stocks:
but in this their hopes were disappointed; for the young man was
so untoward in <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>his disposition, that, notwithstanding the instructions
he daily received, his visits rather tended to alienate than gain
the good-will of his kinswoman.&nbsp; He sometimes looked grave
when the old lady told the jokes of her youth; he often refused
to eat when she pressed him, and was seldom or never provided
with sugar-candy or liquorice when she was seized with a fit of
coughing: nay, he had once the rudeness to fall asleep while she
was describing the composition and virtues of her favourite
cholic-water.&nbsp; In short, be accommodated himself so ill to
her humour, that she died, and did not leave him a farthing.</p>
<p>The other method pointed out to him was an endeavour to get a
lease of some crown-lands, which lay contiguous to his little
paternal estate.&nbsp; This, it was imagined, might be easily
procured, as the crown did not draw so much rent as Harley could
afford to give, with very considerable profit to himself; and the
then lessee had rendered himself so obnoxious to the ministry, by
the disposal of his vote at an election, that he could not expect
a renewal.&nbsp; This, however, needed some interest with the
great, which Harley or his father never possessed.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>His
neighbour, Mr. Walton, having heard of this affair, generously
offered his assistance to accomplish it.&nbsp; He told him, that
though he had long been a stranger to courtiers, yet he believed
there were some of them who might pay regard to his
recommendation; and that, if he thought it worth the while to
take a London journey upon the business, he would furnish him
with a letter of introduction to a baronet of his acquaintance,
who had a great deal to say with the first lord of the
treasury.</p>
<p>When his friends heard of this offer, they pressed him with
the utmost earnestness to accept of it.</p>
<p>They did not fail to enumerate the many advantages which a
certain degree of spirit and assurance gives a man who would make
a figure in the world: they repeated their instances of good
fortune in others, ascribed them all to a happy forwardness of
disposition; and made so copious a recital of the disadvantages
which attend the opposite weakness, that a stranger, who had
heard them, would have been led to imagine, that in the British
code there was some disqualifying statute against any citizen who
should be convicted of&mdash;modesty.</p>
<p>Harley, though he had no great relish for the attempt, yet
could not resist the torrent of motives <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>that
assaulted him; and as he needed but little preparation for his
journey, a day, not very distant, was fixed for his
departure.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MAN OF FEELING IN LOVE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day before that on which he set
out, he went to take leave of Mr. Walton.&mdash;We would conceal
nothing;&mdash;there was another person of the family to whom
also the visit was intended, on whose account, perhaps, there
were some tenderer feelings in the bosom of Harley than his
gratitude for the friendly notice of that gentleman (though he
was seldom deficient in that virtue) could inspire.&nbsp; Mr.
Walton had a daughter; and such a daughter! we will attempt some
description of her by and by.</p>
<p>Harley&rsquo;s notions of the
&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;, or beautiful, were not
always to be defined, nor indeed such as the world would always
assent to, though we could define them.&nbsp; A blush, a phrase
of affability to an inferior, a tear at a moving tale, were to
him, like <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>the Cestus of Cytherea, unequalled in conferring
beauty.&nbsp; For all these Miss Walton was remarkable; but as
these, like the above-mentioned Cestus, are perhaps still more
powerful when the wearer is possessed of some degree of beauty,
commonly so called, it happened, that, from this cause, they had
more than usual power in the person of that young lady.</p>
<p>She was now arrived at that period of life which takes, or is
supposed to take, from the flippancy of girlhood those
sprightlinesses with which some good-natured old maids oblige the
world at three-score.&nbsp; She had been ushered into life (as
that word is used in the dialect of St. James&rsquo;s) at
seventeen, her father being then in parliament, and living in
London: at seventeen, therefore, she had been a universal toast;
her health, now she was four-and-twenty, was only drank by those
who knew her face at least.&nbsp; Her complexion was mellowed
into a paleness, which certainly took from her beauty; but
agreed, at least Harley used to say so, with the pensive softness
of her mind.&nbsp; Her eyes were of that gentle hazel colour
which is rather mild than piercing; and, except when they were
lighted up by good-humour, which was frequently the case, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>were supposed
by the fine gentlemen to want fire.&nbsp; Her air and manner were
elegant in the highest degree, and were as sure of commanding
respect as their mistress was far from demanding it.&nbsp; Her
voice was inexpressibly soft; it was, according to that
incomparable simile of Otway&rsquo;s,</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;like the shepherd&rsquo;s pipe upon
the mountains,<br />
When all his little flock&rsquo;s at feed before him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effect it had upon Harley, himself used to paint
ridiculously enough; and ascribed it to powers, which few
believed, and nobody cared for.</p>
<p>Her conversation was always cheerful, but rarely witty; and
without the smallest affectation of learning, had as much
sentiment in it as would have puzzled a Turk, upon his principles
of female materialism, to account for.&nbsp; Her beneficence was
unbounded; indeed the natural tenderness of her heart might have
been argued, by the frigidity of a casuist, as detracting from
her virtue in this respect, for her humanity was a feeling, not a
principle: but minds like Harley&rsquo;s are not very apt to make
this distinction, and generally give our virtue credit for all
that benevolence which is instinctive in our nature.</p>
<p>As her father had some years retired to the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>country,
Harley had frequent opportunities of seeing her.&nbsp; He looked
on her for some time merely with that respect and admiration
which her appearance seemed to demand, and the opinion of others
conferred upon her from this cause, perhaps, and from that
extreme sensibility of which we have taken frequent notice,
Harley was remarkably silent in her presence.&nbsp; He heard her
sentiments with peculiar attention, sometimes with looks very
expressive of approbation; but seldom declared his opinion on the
subject, much less made compliments to the lady on the justness
of her remarks.</p>
<p>From this very reason it was that Miss Walton frequently took
more particular notice of him than of other visitors, who, by the
laws of precedency, were better entitled to it: it was a mode of
politeness she had peculiarly studied, to bring to the line of
that equality, which is ever necessary for the ease of our
guests, those whose sensibility had placed them below it.</p>
<p>Harley saw this; for though he was a child in the drama of the
world, yet was it not altogether owing to a want of knowledge on
his part; on the contrary, the most delicate consciousness of
propriety often kindled that blush which marred the <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>performance
of it: this raised his esteem something above what the most
sanguine descriptions of her goodness had been able to do; for
certain it is, that notwithstanding the laboured definitions
which very wise men have given us of the inherent beauty of
virtue, we are always inclined to think her handsomest when she
condescends to smile upon ourselves.</p>
<p>It would be trite to observe the easy gradation from esteem to
love: in the bosom of Harley there scarce needed a transition;
for there were certain seasons when his ideas were flushed to a
degree much above their common complexion.&nbsp; In times not
credulous of inspiration, we should account for this from some
natural cause; but we do not mean to account for it at all; it
were sufficient to describe its effects; but they were sometimes
so ludicrous, as might derogate from the dignity of the
sensations which produced them to describe.&nbsp; They were
treated indeed as such by most of Harley&rsquo;s sober friends,
who often laughed very heartily at the awkward blunders of the
real Harley, when the different faculties, which should have
prevented them, were entirely occupied by the ideal.&nbsp; In
some of these paroxysms of fancy, Miss Walton did not <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>fail to be
introduced; and the picture which had been drawn amidst the
surrounding objects of unnoticed levity was now singled out to be
viewed through the medium of romantic imagination: it was
improved of course, and esteem was a word inexpressive of the
feelings which it excited.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HE SETS OUT ON HIS JOURNEY&mdash;THE
BEGGAR AND HIS DOG.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> had taken leave of his aunt on
the eve of his intended departure; but the good lady&rsquo;s
affection for her nephew interrupted her sleep, and early as it
was next morning when Harley came downstairs to set out, he found
her in the parlour with a tear on her cheek, and her caudle-cup
in her hand.&nbsp; She knew enough of physic to prescribe against
going abroad of a morning with an empty stomach.&nbsp; She gave
her blessing with the draught; her instructions she had delivered
the night before.&nbsp; They consisted mostly of negatives, for
London, in <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>her idea, was so replete with temptations that it needed
the whole armour of her friendly cautions to repel their
attacks.</p>
<p>Peter stood at the door.&nbsp; We have mentioned this faithful
fellow formerly: Harley&rsquo;s father had taken him up an
orphan, and saved him from being cast on the parish; and he had
ever since remained in the service of him and of his son.&nbsp;
Harley shook him by the hand as he passed, smiling, as if he had
said, &ldquo;I will not weep.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sprung hastily into
the chaise that waited for him; Peter folded up the step.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear master,&rdquo; said he, shaking the solitary lock
that hung on either side of his head, &ldquo;I have been told as
how London is a sad place.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was choked with the
thought, and his benediction could not be heard:&mdash;but it
shall be heard, honest Peter! where these tears will add to its
energy.</p>
<p>In a few hours Harley reached the inn where he proposed
breakfasting, but the fulness of his heart would not suffer him
to eat a morsel.&nbsp; He walked out on the road, and gaining a
little height, stood gazing on that quarter he had left.&nbsp; He
looked for his wonted prospect, his fields, his woods, and his
hills: they were lost in the distant clouds!&nbsp; He <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>pencilled
them on the clouds, and bade them farewell with a sigh!</p>
<p>He sat down on a large stone to take out a little pebble from
his shoe, when he saw, at some distance, a beggar approaching
him.&nbsp; He had on a loose sort of coat, mended with
different-coloured rags, amongst which the blue and the russet
were the predominant.&nbsp; He had a short knotty stick in his
hand, and on the top of it was stuck a ram&rsquo;s horn; his
knees (though he was no pilgrim) had worn the stuff of his
breeches; he wore no shoes, and his stockings had entirely lost
that part of them which should have covered his feet and ankles;
in his face, however, was the plump appearance of good humour; he
walked a good round pace, and a crook-legged dog trotted at his
heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our delicacies,&rdquo; said Harley to himself,
&ldquo;are fantastic; they are not in nature! that beggar walks
over the sharpest of these stones barefooted, whilst I have lost
the most delightful dream in the world, from the smallest of them
happening to get into my shoe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The beggar had by
this time come up, and, pulling off a piece of hat, asked charity
of Harley; the dog began to beg too:&mdash;it was impossible <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>to resist
both; and, in truth, the want of shoes and stockings had made
both unnecessary, for Harley had destined sixpence for him
before.&nbsp; The beggar, on receiving it, poured forth blessings
without number; and, with a sort of smile on his countenance,
said to Harley &ldquo;that if he wanted to have his fortune
told&rdquo;&mdash;Harley turned his eye briskly on the beggar: it
was an unpromising look for the subject of a prediction, and
silenced the prophet immediately.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would much
rather learn,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;what it is in your power
to tell me: your trade must be an entertaining one; sit down on
this stone, and let me know something of your profession; I have
often thought of turning fortune-teller for a week or two
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; replied the beggar, &ldquo;I like your
frankness much; God knows I had the humour of plain-dealing in me
from a child, but there is no doing with it in this world; we
must live as we can, and lying is, as you call it, my profession,
but I was in some sort forced to the trade, for I dealt once in
telling truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a labourer, sir, and gained as much as to make me
live: I never laid by indeed: for I was <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>reckoned a
piece of a wag, and your wags, I take it, are seldom rich, Mr.
Harley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;you seem to know
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, there are few folks in the country that I
don&rsquo;t know something of: how should I tell fortunes
else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; but to go on with your story: you were a
labourer, you say, and a wag; your industry, I suppose, you left
with your old trade, but your humour you preserve to be of use to
you in your new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What signifies sadness, sir? a man grows lean
on&rsquo;t: but I was brought to my idleness by degrees; first I
could not work, and it went against my stomach to work ever
after.&nbsp; I was seized with a jail fever at the time of the
assizes being in the county where I lived; for I was always
curious to get acquainted with the felons, because they are
commonly fellows of much mirth and little thought, qualities I
had ever an esteem for.&nbsp; In the height of this fever, Mr.
Harley, the house where I lay took fire, and burnt to the ground;
I was carried out in that condition, and lay all the rest of my
illness in a barn.&nbsp; I got the better of my disease, however,
but I was so weak that I spit <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>blood whenever I attempted to
work.&nbsp; I had no relation living that I knew of, and I never
kept a friend above a week, when I was able to joke; I seldom
remained above six months in a parish, so that I might have died
before I had found a settlement in any: thus I was forced to beg
my bread, and a sorry trade I found it, Mr. Harley.&nbsp; I told
all my misfortunes truly, but they were seldom believed; and the
few who gave me a halfpenny as they passed did it with a shake of
the head, and an injunction not to trouble them with a long
story.&nbsp; In short, I found that people don&rsquo;t care to
give alms without some security for their money; a wooden leg or
a withered arm is a sort of draught upon heaven for those who
choose to have their money placed to account there; so I changed
my plan, and, instead of telling my own misfortunes, began to
prophesy happiness to others.&nbsp; This I found by much the
better way: folks will always listen when the tale is their own,
and of many who say they do not believe in fortune-telling, I
have known few on whom it had not a very sensible effect.&nbsp; I
pick up the names of their acquaintance; amours and little
squabbles are easily gleaned among servants and neighbours; and
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>indeed
people themselves are the best intelligencers in the world for
our purpose: they dare not puzzle us for their own sakes, for
every one is anxious to hear what they wish to believe, and they
who repeat it, to laugh at it when they have done, are generally
more serious than their hearers are apt to imagine.&nbsp; With a
tolerable good memory, and some share of cunning, with the help
of walking a-nights over heaths and church-yards, with this, and
showing the tricks of that there dog, whom I stole from the
serjeant of a marching regiment (and by the way, he can steal too
upon occasion), I make shift to pick up a livelihood.&nbsp; My
trade, indeed, is none of the honestest; yet people are not much
cheated neither who give a few half-pence for a prospect of
happiness, which I have heard some persons say is all a man can
arrive at in this world.&nbsp; But I must bid you good day, sir,
for I have three miles to walk before noon, to inform some
boarding-school young ladies whether their husbands are to be
peers of the realm or captains in the army: a question which I
promised to answer them by that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley had drawn a shilling from his pocket; but Virtue bade
him consider on whom he was <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>going to bestow it.&nbsp; Virtue held
back his arm; but a milder form, a younger sister of
Virtue&rsquo;s, not so severe as Virtue, nor so serious as Pity,
smiled upon him; his fingers lost their compression, nor did
Virtue offer to catch the money as it fell.&nbsp; It had no
sooner reached the ground than the watchful cur (a trick he had
been taught) snapped it up, and, contrary to the most approved
method of stewardship, delivered it immediately into the hands of
his master.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HE MAKES A SECOND EXPEDITION TO THE
BARONET&rsquo;S.&nbsp; THE LAUDABLE AMBITION OF A YOUNG MAN TO BE
THOUGHT SOMETHING BY THE WORLD.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have related, in a former
chapter, the little success of his first visit to the great man,
for whom he had the introductory letter from Mr. Walton.&nbsp; To
people of equal sensibility, the influence of those trifles we
mentioned on his deportment will not appear surprising, but to
his friends in the <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>country they could not be stated, nor would they have
allowed them any place in the account.&nbsp; In some of their
letters, therefore, which he received soon after, they expressed
their surprise at his not having been more urgent in his
application, and again recommended the blushless assiduity of
successful merit.</p>
<p>He resolved to make another attempt at the baronet&rsquo;s;
fortified with higher notions of his own dignity, and with less
apprehension of repulse.&nbsp; In his way to Grosvenor Square he
began to ruminate on the folly of mankind, who affixed those
ideas of superiority to riches, which reduced the minds of men,
by nature equal with the more fortunate, to that sort of
servility which he felt in his own.&nbsp; By the time he had
reached the Square, and was walking along the pavement which led
to the baronet&rsquo;s, he had brought his reasoning on the
subject to such a point, that the conclusion, by every rule of
logic, should have led him to a thorough indifference in his
approaches to a fellow-mortal, whether that fellow-mortal was
possessed of six or six thousand pounds a year.&nbsp; It is
probable, however, that the premises had been improperly formed:
for it is certain, that when he <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>approached the great man&rsquo;s door
he felt his heart agitated by an unusual pulsation.</p>
<p>He had almost reached it, when he observed among gentleman
coming out, dressed in a white frock and a red laced waistcoat,
with a small switch in his hand, which he seemed to manage with a
particular good grace.&nbsp; As he passed him on the steps, the
stranger very politely made him a bow, which Harley returned,
though he could not remember ever having seen him before.&nbsp;
He asked Harley, in the same civil manner, if he was going to
wait on his friend the baronet.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I was just
calling,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and am sorry to find that he is
gone for some days into the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley thanked him for his information, and was turning from
the door, when the other observed that it would be proper to
leave his name, and very obligingly knocked for that purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a gentleman, Tom, who meant to have waited on
your master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name, if you please, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember, Tom, Harley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was shut.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since we are here,&rdquo; said
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>he,
&ldquo;we shall not lose our walk if we add a little to it by a
turn or two in Hyde Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He accompanied this proposal with a second bow, and Harley
accepted of it by another in return.</p>
<p>The conversation, as they walked, was brilliant on the side of
his companion.&nbsp; The playhouse, the opera, with every
occurrence in high life, he seemed perfectly master of; and
talked of some reigning beauties of quality in a manner the most
feeling in the world.&nbsp; Harley admired the happiness of his
vivacity, and, opposite as it was to the reserve of his own
nature, began to be much pleased with its effects.</p>
<p>Though I am not of opinion with some wise men, that the
existence of objects depends on idea, yet I am convinced that
their appearance is not a little influenced by it.&nbsp; The
optics of some minds are in so unlucky a perspective as to throw
a certain shade on every picture that is presented to them, while
those of others (of which number was Harley), like the mirrors of
the ladies, have a wonderful effect in bettering their
complexions.&nbsp; Through such a medium perhaps he was looking
on his present companion.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>When
they had finished their walk, and were returning by the corner of
the Park, they observed a board hung out of a window signifying,
&ldquo;An excellent <span class="GutSmall">ORDINARY</span> on
Saturdays and Sundays.&rdquo;&nbsp; It happened to be Saturday,
and the table was covered for the purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if we should go in and dine here, if you happen
not to be engaged, sir?&rdquo; said the young gentleman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not impossible but we shall meet with some original
or other; it is a sort of humour I like hugely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley made no objection, and the stranger showed him the way
into the parlour.</p>
<p>He was placed, by the courtesy of his introductor, in an
arm-chair that stood at one side of the fire.&nbsp; Over against
him was seated a man of a grave considering aspect, with that
look of sober prudence which indicates what is commonly called a
warm man.&nbsp; He wore a pretty large wig, which had once been
white, but was now of a brownish yellow; his coat was one of
those modest-coloured drabs which mock the injuries of dust and
dirt; two jack-boots concealed, in part, the well-mended knees of
an old pair of buckskin breeches; while the spotted handkerchief
round his neck preserved <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>at once its owner from catching cold
and his neck-cloth from being dirtied.&nbsp; Next him sat another
man, with a tankard in his hand and a quid of tobacco in his
cheek, whose eye was rather more vivacious, and whose dress was
something smarter.</p>
<p>The first-mentioned gentleman took notice that the room had
been so lately washed, as not to have had time to dry, and
remarked that wet lodging was unwholesome for man or beast.&nbsp;
He looked round at the same time for a poker to stir the fire
with, which, he at last observed to the company, the people of
the house had removed in order to save their coals.&nbsp; This
difficulty, however, he overcame by the help of Harley&rsquo;s
stick, saying, &ldquo;that as they should, no doubt, pay for
their fire in some shape or other, he saw no reason why they
should not have the use of it while they sat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was now opened for the admission of dinner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is with you, gentlemen,&rdquo;
said Harley&rsquo;s new acquaintance, &ldquo;but I am afraid I
shall not be able to get down a morsel at this horrid mechanical
hour of dining.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sat down, however, and did not
show any want of appetite by his eating.&nbsp; He took upon him
the <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>carving of the meat, and criticised on the goodness of
the pudding.</p>
<p>When the table-cloth was removed, he proposed calling for some
punch, which was readily agreed to; he seemed at first inclined
to make it himself, but afterwards changed his mind, and left
that province to the waiter, telling him to have it pure West
Indian, or he could not taste a drop of it.</p>
<p>When the punch was brought he undertook to fill the glasses
and call the toasts.&nbsp; &ldquo;The King.&rdquo;&mdash;The
toast naturally produced politics.&nbsp; It is the privilege of
Englishmen to drink the king&rsquo;s health, and to talk of his
conduct.&nbsp; The man who sat opposite to Harley (and who by
this time, partly from himself, and partly from his acquaintance
on his left hand, was discovered to be a grazier) observed,
&ldquo;That it was a shame for so many pensioners to be allowed
to take the bread out of the mouth of the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and provisions,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;were
never so dear in the memory of man; I wish the king and his
counsellors would look to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the matter of provisions, neighbour
Wrightson,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am sure the prices of
cattle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>A
dispute would have probably ensued, but it was prevented by the
spruce toastmaster, who gave a sentiment, and turning to the two
politicians, &ldquo;Pray, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let
us have done with these musty politics: I would always leave them
to the beer-suckers in Butcher Row.&nbsp; Come, let us have
something of the fine arts.&nbsp; That was a damn&rsquo;d hard
match between Joe the Nailor and Tim Bucket.&nbsp; The knowing
ones were cursedly taken in there!&nbsp; I lost a cool hundred
myself, faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At mention of the cool hundred, the grazier threw his eyes
aslant, with a mingled look of doubt and surprise; while the man
at his elbow looked arch, and gave a short emphatical sort of
cough.</p>
<p>Both seemed to be silenced, however, by this intelligence; and
while the remainder of the punch lasted the conversation was
wholly engrossed by the gentleman with the fine waistcoat, who
told a great many &ldquo;immense comical stories&rdquo; and
&ldquo;confounded smart things,&rdquo; as he termed them, acted
and spoken by lords, ladies, and young bucks of quality, of his
acquaintance.&nbsp; At last, the grazier, pulling out a watch, of
a very unusual size, and telling the hour, said that he had an
appointment.&nbsp; <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>&ldquo;Is it so late?&rdquo; said the young gentleman;
&ldquo;then I am afraid I have missed an appointment already; but
the truth is, I am cursedly given to missing of
appointments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the grazier and he were gone, Harley turned to the
remaining personage, and asked him if he knew that young
gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;A gentleman!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;ay,
he is one of your gentlemen at the top of an affidavit.&nbsp; I
knew him, some years ago, in the quality of a footman; and I
believe he had some times the honour to be a pimp.&nbsp; At last,
some of the great folks, to whom he had been serviceable in both
capacities, had him made a gauger; in which station he remains,
and has the assurance to pretend an acquaintance with men of
quality.&nbsp; The impudent dog! with a few shillings in his
pocket, he will talk you three times as much as my friend Mundy
there, who is worth nine thousand if he&rsquo;s worth a
farthing.&nbsp; But I know the rascal, and despise him, as he
deserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley began to despise him too, and to conceive some
indignation at having sat with patience to hear such a fellow
speak nonsense.&nbsp; But he corrected himself by reflecting that
he was perhaps as well entertained, and instructed too, by this
same modest <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>gauger, as he should have been by such a man as he had
thought proper to personate.&nbsp; And surely the fault may more
properly be imputed to that rank where the futility is real than
where it is feigned: to that rank whose opportunities for nobler
accomplishments have only served to rear a fabric of folly which
the untutored hand of affectation, even among the meanest of
mankind, can imitate with success.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HE VISITS BEDLAM.&mdash;THE DISTRESSES OF
A DAUGHTER.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> those things called Sights in
London, which every stranger is supposed desirous to see, Bedlam
is one.&nbsp; To that place, therefore, an acquaintance of
Harley&rsquo;s, after having accompanied him to several other
shows, proposed a visit.&nbsp; Harley objected to it,
&ldquo;because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think it an inhuman
practice to expose the greatest misery with which our nature is
afflicted to every idle visitant who can afford a trifling
perquisite to the <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>keeper; especially as it is a distress which the humane
must see, with the painful reflection, that it is not in their
power to alleviate it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was overpowered, however,
by the solicitations of his friend and the other persons of the
party (amongst whom were several ladies); and they went in a body
to Moorfields.</p>
<p>Their conductor led them first to the dismal mansions of those
who are in the most horrid state of incurable madness.&nbsp; The
clanking of chains, the wildness of their cries, and the
imprecations which some of them uttered, formed a scene
inexpressibly shocking.&nbsp; Harley and his companions,
especially the female part of them, begged their guide to return;
he seemed surprised at their uneasiness, and was with difficulty
prevailed on to leave that part of the house without showing them
some others: who, as he expressed it in the phrase of those that
keep wild beasts for show, were much better worth seeing than any
they had passed, being ten times more fierce and
unmanageable.</p>
<p>He led them next to that quarter where those reside who, as
they are not dangerous to themselves or others, enjoy a certain
degree of freedom, according to the state of their distemper.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Harley
had fallen behind his companions, looking at a man who was making
pendulums with bits of thread and little balls of clay.&nbsp; He
had delineated a segment of a circle on the wall with chalk, and
marked their different vibrations by intersecting it with cross
lines.&nbsp; A decent-looking man came up, and smiling at the
maniac, turned to Harley, and told him that gentleman had once
been a very celebrated mathematician.&nbsp; &ldquo;He fell a
sacrifice,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to the theory of comets; for
having, with infinite labour, formed a table on the conjectures
of Sir Isaac Newton, he was disappointed in the return of one of
those luminaries, and was very soon after obliged to be placed
here by his friends.&nbsp; If you please to follow me,
sir,&rdquo; continued the stranger, &ldquo;I believe I shall be
able to give you a more satisfactory account of the unfortunate
people you see here than the man who attends your
companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley bowed, and accepted his offer.</p>
<p>The next person they came up to had scrawled a variety of
figures on a piece of slate.&nbsp; Harley had the curiosity to
take a nearer view of them.&nbsp; They consisted of different
columns, on the top of which were marked South-sea annuities,
India-stock, and Three per cent. annuities consol.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Harley&rsquo;s instructor, &ldquo;was
a gentleman well known in Change Alley.&nbsp; He was once worth
fifty thousand pounds, and had actually agreed for the purchase
of an estate in the West, in order to realise his money; but he
quarrelled with the proprietor about the repairs of the garden
wall, and so returned to town, to follow his old trade of
stock-jobbing a little longer; when an unlucky fluctuation of
stock, in which he was engaged to an immense extent, reduced him
at once to poverty and to madness.&nbsp; Poor wretch! he told me
t&rsquo;other day that against the next payment of differences he
should be some hundreds above a plum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a spondee, and I will maintain it,&rdquo;
interrupted a voice on his left hand.&nbsp; This assertion was
followed by a very rapid recital of some verses from Homer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That figure,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;whose
clothes are so bedaubed with snuff, was a schoolmaster of some
reputation: he came hither to be resolved of some doubts he
entertained concerning the genuine pronunciation of the Greek
vowels.&nbsp; In his highest fits, he makes frequent mention of
one Mr. Bentley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But delusive ideas, sir, are the motives of the
greatest part of mankind, and a heated imagination <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the power by
which their actions are incited: the world, in the eye of a
philosopher, may be said to be a large madhouse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; answered Harley, &ldquo;the passions of
men are temporary madnesses; and sometimes very fatal in their
effects.</p>
<blockquote><p>From Macedonia&rsquo;s madman to the
Swede.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was, indeed,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;a very
mad thing in Charles to think of adding so vast a country as
Russia to his dominions: that would have been fatal indeed; the
balance of the North would then have been lost; but the Sultan
and I would never have allowed
it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Harley, with no small
surprise on his countenance.&mdash;&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo;
answered the other, &ldquo;the Sultan and I; do you know
me?&nbsp; I am the Chan of Tartary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley was a good deal struck by this discovery; he had
prudence enough, however, to conceal his amazement, and bowing as
low to the monarch as his dignity required, left him immediately,
and joined his companions.</p>
<p>He found them in a quarter of the house set apart for the
insane of the other sex, several of whom had gathered about the
female visitors, and were examining, with rather more accuracy
than might have been expected, the particulars of their
dress.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Separate from the rest stood one whose appearance had
something of superior dignity.&nbsp; Her face, though pale and
wasted, was less squalid than those of the others, and showed a
dejection of that decent kind, which moves our pity unmixed with
horror: upon her, therefore, the eyes of all were immediately
turned.&nbsp; The keeper who accompanied them observed it:
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a young lady who was born
to ride in her coach and six.&nbsp; She was beloved, if the story
I have heard is true, by a young gentleman, her equal in birth,
though by no means her match in fortune: but love, they say, is
blind, and so she fancied him as much as he did her.&nbsp; Her
father, it seems, would not hear of their marriage, and
threatened to turn her out of doors if ever she saw him
again.&nbsp; Upon this the young gentleman took a voyage to the
West Indies, in hopes of bettering his fortune, and obtaining his
mistress; but he was scarce landed, when he was seized with one
of the fevers which are common in those islands, and died in a
few days, lamented by every one that knew him.&nbsp; This news
soon reached his mistress, who was at the same time pressed by
her father to marry a rich miserly fellow, who was old enough to
be her grandfather.&nbsp; <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>The death of her lover had no effect
on her inhuman parent: he was only the more earnest for her
marriage with the man he had provided for her; and what between
her despair at the death of the one, and her aversion to the
other, the poor young lady was reduced to the condition you see
her in.&nbsp; But God would not prosper such cruelty; her
father&rsquo;s affairs soon after went to wreck, and he died
almost a beggar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though this story was told in very plain language, it had
particularly attracted Harley&rsquo;s notice; he had given it the
tribute of some tears.&nbsp; The unfortunate young lady had till
now seemed entranced in thought, with her eyes fixed on a little
garnet ring she wore on her finger; she turned them now upon
Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Billy is no more!&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;do you weep for my Billy?&nbsp; Blessings on your
tears!&nbsp; I would weep too, but my brain is dry; and it burns,
it burns, it burns!&rdquo;&mdash;She drew nearer to
Harley.&mdash;&ldquo;Be comforted, young lady,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;your Billy is in heaven.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Is he,
indeed? and shall we meet again? and shall that frightful man
(pointing to the keeper) not be there!&mdash;Alas!&nbsp; I am
grown naughty of late; I have almost forgotten to think of
heaven: yet I pray sometimes; when I <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>can, I pray; and sometimes I sing;
when I am saddest, I sing:&mdash;You shall hear
me&mdash;hush!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Light be the earth on Billy&rsquo;s
breast,<br />
And green the sod that wraps his grave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a plaintive wildness in the air not to be withstood;
and, except the keeper&rsquo;s, there was not an unmoistened eye
around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you weep again?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
would not have you weep: you are like my Billy; you are, believe
me; just so he looked when he gave me this ring; poor Billy!
&rsquo;twas the last time ever we met!&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas when the seas were roaring&mdash;I love you
for resembling my Billy; but I shall never love any man like
him.&rdquo;&mdash;She stretched out her hand to Harley; he
pressed it between both of his, and bathed it with his
tears.&mdash;&ldquo;Nay, that is Billy&rsquo;s ring,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;you cannot have it, indeed; but here is another, look
here, which I plated to-day of some gold-thread from this bit of
stuff; will you keep it for my sake?&nbsp; I am a strange girl;
but my heart is harmless: my poor heart; it will burst some day;
feel how it beats!&rdquo;&nbsp; She pressed his hand to her
bosom, then holding her head in the attitude of
listening&mdash;&ldquo;Hark! one, two, three! be <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>quiet, thou
little trembler; my Billy is cold!&mdash;but I had forgotten the
ring.&rdquo;&mdash;She put it on his finger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Farewell!&nbsp; I must leave you now.&rdquo;&mdash;She
would have withdrawn her hand; Harley held it to his
lips.&mdash;&ldquo;I dare not stay longer; my head throbs sadly:
farewell!&rdquo;&mdash;She walked with a hurried step to a little
apartment at some distance.&nbsp; Harley stood fixed in
astonishment and pity; his friend gave money to the
keeper.&mdash;Harley looked on his ring.&mdash;He put a couple of
guineas into the man&rsquo;s hand: &ldquo;Be kind to that
unfortunate.&rdquo;&mdash;He burst into tears, and left them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MISANTHROPE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> friend who had conducted him to
Moorfields called upon him again the next evening.&nbsp; After
some talk on the adventures of the preceding day: &ldquo;I
carried you yesterday,&rdquo; said he to Harley, &ldquo;to visit
the mad; let me introduce you to-night, at supper, to one of the
wise: but you must not look <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>for anything of the Socratic
pleasantry about him; on the contrary, I warn you to expect the
spirit of a Diogenes.&nbsp; That you may be a little prepared for
his extraordinary manner, I will let you into some particulars of
his history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the elder of the two sons of a gentleman of
considerable estate in the country.&nbsp; Their father died when
they were young: both were remarkable at school for quickness of
parts and extent of genius; this had been bred to no profession,
because his father&rsquo;s fortune, which descended to him, was
thought sufficient to set him above it; the other was put
apprentice to an eminent attorney.&nbsp; In this the expectations
of his friends were more consulted than his own inclination; for
both his brother and he had feelings of that warm kind that could
ill brook a study so dry as the law, especially in that
department of it which was allotted to him.&nbsp; But the
difference of their tempers made the characteristical distinction
between them.&nbsp; The younger, from the gentleness of his
nature, bore with patience a situation entirely discordant to his
genius and disposition.&nbsp; At times, indeed, his pride would
suggest of how little importance those talents were which the
partiality of his friends had often extolled: they <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>were now
incumbrances in a walk of life where the dull and the ignorant
passed him at every turn; his fancy and his feeling were
invincible obstacles to eminence in a situation where his fancy
had no room for exertion, and his feeling experienced perpetual
disgust.&nbsp; But these murmurings he never suffered to be
heard; and that he might not offend the prudence of those who had
been concerned in the choice of his profession, he continued to
labour in it several years, till, by the death of a relation, he
succeeded to an estate of a little better than &pound;100 a year,
with which, and the small patrimony left him, he retired into the
country, and made a love-match with a young lady of a similar
temper to his own, with whom the sagacious world pitied him for
finding happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his elder brother, whom you are to see at supper,
if you will do us the favour of your company, was naturally
impetuous, decisive, and overbearing.&nbsp; He entered into life
with those ardent expectations by which young men are commonly
deluded: in his friendships, warm to excess; and equally violent
in his dislikes.&nbsp; He was on the brink of marriage with a
young lady, when one of those friends, for whose honour he would
have pawned his life, made <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>an elopement with that very goddess,
and left him besides deeply engaged for sums which that good
friend&rsquo;s extravagance had squandered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dreams he had formerly enjoyed were now changed for
ideas of a very different nature.&nbsp; He abjured all confidence
in anything of human form; sold his lands, which still produced
him a very large reversion, came to town, and immured himself,
with a woman who had been his nurse, in little better than a
garret; and has ever since applied his talents to the vilifying
of his species.&nbsp; In one thing I must take the liberty to
instruct you; however different your sentiments may be (and
different they must be), you will suffer him to go on without
contradiction; otherwise, he will be silent immediately, and we
shall not get a word from him all the night after.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Harley promised to remember this injunction, and accepted the
invitation of his friend.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the house, they were informed that the
gentleman was come, and had been shown into the parlour.&nbsp;
They found him sitting with a daughter of his friend&rsquo;s,
about three years old, on his knee, whom he was teaching the
alphabet from a horn book: at a little distance stood a <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>sister of
hers, some years older.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get you away, miss,&rdquo;
said he to this last; &ldquo;you are a pert gossip, and I will
have nothing to do with you.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo;
answered she, &ldquo;Nancy is your favourite; you are quite in
love with Nancy.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Take away that girl,&rdquo;
said he to her father, whom he now observed to have entered the
room; &ldquo;she has woman about her already.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
children were accordingly dismissed.</p>
<p>Betwixt that and supper-time he did not utter a
syllable.&nbsp; When supper came, he quarrelled with every dish
at table, but eat of them all; only exempting from his censures a
salad, &ldquo;which you have not spoiled,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;because you have not attempted to cook it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the wine was set upon the table, he took from his pocket
a particular smoking apparatus, and filled his pipe, without
taking any more notice of Harley, or his friend, than if no such
persons had been in the room.</p>
<p>Harley could not help stealing a look of surprise at him; but
his friend, who knew his humour, returned it by annihilating his
presence in the like manner, and, leaving him to his own
meditations, addressed himself entirely to Harley.</p>
<p>In their discourse some mention happened to be <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>made of an
amiable character, and the words <i>honour</i> and
<i>politeness</i> were applied to it.&nbsp; Upon this, the
gentleman, laying down his pipe, and changing the tone of his
countenance, from an ironical grin to something more intently
contemptuous: &ldquo;Honour,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;Honour and
Politeness! this is the coin of the world, and passes current
with the fools of it.&nbsp; You have substituted the shadow
Honour, instead of the substance Virtue; and have banished the
reality of friendship for the fictitious semblance which you have
termed Politeness: politeness, which consists in a certain
ceremonious jargon, more ridiculous to the ear of reason than the
voice of a puppet.&nbsp; You have invented sounds, which you
worship, though they tyrannize over your peace; and are
surrounded with empty forms, which take from the honest emotions
of joy, and add to the poignancy of misfortune.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Harley&mdash;his friend winked to him, to
remind him of the caution he had received.&nbsp; He was silenced
by the thought.&nbsp; The philosopher turned his eye upon him: he
examined him from top to toe, with a sort of triumphant contempt;
Harley&rsquo;s coat happened to be a new one; the other&rsquo;s
was as shabby as could <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>possibly be supposed to be on the
back of a gentleman: there was much significance in his look with
regard to this coat; it spoke of the sleekness of folly and the
threadbareness of wisdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;the most amiable, as
well as the most natural of virtues, you are at pains to
eradicate.&nbsp; Your very nurseries are seminaries of falsehood;
and what is called Fashion in manhood completes the system of
avowed insincerity.&nbsp; Mankind, in the gross, is a gaping
monster, that loves to be deceived, and has seldom been
disappointed: nor is their vanity less fallacious to your
philosophers, who adopt modes of truth to follow them through the
paths of error, and defend paradoxes merely to be singular in
defending them.&nbsp; These are they whom ye term Ingenious;
&rsquo;tis a phrase of commendation I detest: it implies an
attempt to impose on my judgment, by flattering my imagination;
yet these are they whose works are read by the old with delight,
which the young are taught to look upon as the codes of knowledge
and philosophy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, the education of your youth is every way
preposterous; you waste at school years in improving talents,
without having ever spent an hour <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>in discovering them; one promiscuous
line of instruction is followed, without regard to genius,
capacity, or probable situation in the commonwealth.&nbsp; From
this bear-garden of the pedagogue, a raw, unprincipled boy is
turned loose upon the world to travel; without any ideas but
those of improving his dress at Paris, or starting into taste by
gazing on some paintings at Rome.&nbsp; Ask him of the manners of
the people, and he will tell you that the skirt is worn much
shorter in France, and that everybody eats macaroni in
Italy.&nbsp; When he returns home, he buys a seat in parliament,
and studies the constitution at Arthur&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor are your females trained to any more useful
purpose: they are taught, by the very rewards which their nurses
propose for good behaviour, by the first thing like a jest which
they hear from every male visitor of the family, that a young
woman is a creature to be married; and when they are grown
somewhat older, are instructed that it is the purpose of marriage
to have the enjoyment of pin-money, and the expectation of a
jointure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These, <a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a> indeed, are the effects of luxury, <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>which is,
perhaps, inseparable from a certain degree of power and grandeur
in a nation.&nbsp; But it is not simply of the progress of luxury
that we have to complain: did its votaries keep in their own
sphere of thoughtless dissipation, we might despise them without
emotion; but the frivolous pursuits of pleasure are mingled with
the most important concerns of the state; and public enterprise
shall sleep till he who should guide its operation has decided
his bets at Newmarket, or fulfilled his engagement with a
favourite mistress in the country.&nbsp; We want some man of
acknowledged eminence to point our counsels with that firmness
which the counsels of a great people require.&nbsp; We have
hundreds of ministers, who press forward into office without
having ever learned that art which is necessary for every
business: the art of thinking; and mistake the petulance, which
could give <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>inspiration to smart sarcasms on an obnoxious measure in
a popular assembly, for the ability which is to balance the
interest of kingdoms, and investigate the latent sources of
national superiority.&nbsp; With the administration of such men
the people can never be satisfied; for besides that their
confidence is gained only by the view of superior talents, there
needs that depth of knowledge, which is not only acquainted with
the just extent of power, but can also trace its connection with
the expedient, to preserve its possessors from the contempt which
attends irresolution, or the resentment which follows
temerity.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>[Here a considerable part is wanting.]</p>
<p>* * &ldquo;In short, man is an animal equally selfish and
vain.&nbsp; Vanity, indeed, is but a modification of
selfishness.&nbsp; From the latter, there are some who pretend to
be free: they are generally such as declaim against the lust of
wealth and power, because they have never been able to attain any
high degree in either: they boast of generosity and
feeling.&nbsp; They tell us (perhaps they tell us in rhyme) that
the sensations of an honest heart, of a mind universally
benevolent, make up the quiet <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>bliss which they enjoy; but they will
not, by this, be exempted from the charge of selfishness.&nbsp;
Whence the luxurious happiness they describe in their little
family-circles?&nbsp; Whence the pleasure which they feel, when
they trim their evening fires, and listen to the howl of
winter&rsquo;s wind?&nbsp; Whence, but from the secret reflection
of what houseless wretches feel from it?&nbsp; Or do you
administer comfort in affliction&mdash;the motive is at hand; I
have had it preached to me in nineteen out of twenty of your
consolatory discourses&mdash;the comparative littleness of our
own misfortunes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With vanity your best virtues are grossly tainted: your
benevolence, which ye deduce immediately from the natural impulse
of the heart, squints to it for its reward.&nbsp; There are some,
indeed, who tell us of the satisfaction which flows from a secret
consciousness of good actions: this secret satisfaction is truly
excellent&mdash;when we have some friend to whom we may discover
its excellence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He now paused a moment to re-light his pipe, when a clock,
that stood at his back, struck eleven; he started up at the
sound, took his hat and his cane, and nodding good night with his
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>head,
walked out of the room.&nbsp; The gentleman of the house called a
servant to bring the stranger&rsquo;s surtout.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
sort of a night is it, fellow?&rdquo; said he.&mdash;&ldquo;It
rains, sir,&rdquo; answered the servant, &ldquo;with an easterly
wind.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Easterly for ever!&rdquo;&nbsp; He made
no other reply; but shrugging up his shoulders till they almost
touched his ears, wrapped himself tight in his great coat, and
disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a strange creature,&rdquo; said his friend to
Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot say,&rdquo; answered he,
&ldquo;that his remarks are of the pleasant kind: it is curious
to observe how the nature of truth may be changed by the garb it
wears; softened to the admonition of friendship, or soured into
the severity of reproof: yet this severity may be useful to some
tempers; it somewhat resembles a file: disagreeable in its
operation, but hard metals may be the brighter for it.&rdquo;</p>

66</span>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HIS SKILL IN PHYSIOGNOMY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> company at the baronet&rsquo;s
removed to the playhouse accordingly, and Harley took his usual
route into the Park.&nbsp; He observed, as he entered, a
fresh-looking elderly gentleman in conversation with a beggar,
who, leaning on his crutch, was recounting the hardships he had
undergone, and explaining the wretchedness of his present
condition.&nbsp; This was a very interesting dialogue to Harley;
he was rude enough, therefore, to slacken his pace as he
approached, and at last to make a full stop at the
gentleman&rsquo;s back, who was just then expressing his
compassion for the beggar, and regretting that he had not a
farthing of change about him.&nbsp; At saying this, he looked
piteously on the fellow: there was something in his physiognomy
which caught Harley&rsquo;s notice: indeed, physiognomy was one
of Harley&rsquo;s foibles, for which he had been often rebuked by
his aunt in the country, who used to tell him that when he was
come to her years and experience he would know that all&rsquo;s
not gold that <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>glitters: and it must be owned that his aunt was a very
sensible, harsh-looking maiden lady of threescore and
upwards.&nbsp; But he was too apt to forget this caution and now,
it seems, it had not occurred to him.&nbsp; Stepping up,
therefore, to the gentleman, who was lamenting the want of
silver, &ldquo;Your intentions, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are
so good, that I cannot help lending you my assistance to carry
them into execution,&rdquo; and gave the beggar a shilling.&nbsp;
The other returned a suitable compliment, and extolled the
benevolence of Harley.&nbsp; They kept walking together, and
benevolence grew the topic of discourse.</p>
<p>The stranger was fluent on the subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
no use of money,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;equal to that of
beneficence.&nbsp; With the profuse, it is lost; and even with
those who lay it out according to the prudence of the world, the
objects acquired by it pall on the sense, and have scarce become
our own till they lose their value with the power of pleasing;
but here the enjoyment grows on reflection, and our money is most
truly ours when it ceases being in our possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I agree in some measure,&rdquo; answered Harley,
&ldquo;with those who think that charity to our <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>common
beggars is often misplaced; there are objects less obtrusive
whose title is a better one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot easily distinguish,&rdquo; said the stranger;
&ldquo;and even of the worthless, are there not many whose
imprudence, or whose vice, may have been one dreadful consequence
of misfortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley looked again in his face, and blessed himself for his
skill in physiognomy.</p>
<p>By this time they had reached the end of the walk, the old
gentleman leaning on the rails to take breath, and in the
meantime they were joined by a younger man, whose figure was much
above the appearance of his dress, which was poor and
shabby.&nbsp; Harley&rsquo;s former companion addressed him as an
acquaintance, and they turned on the walk together.</p>
<p>The elder of the strangers complained of the closeness of the
evening, and asked the other if he would go with him into a house
hard by, and take one draught of excellent cyder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The man who keeps this house,&rdquo; said he to Harley,
&ldquo;was once a servant of mine.&nbsp; I could not think of
turning loose upon the world a faithful old fellow, for no other
reason but that his age had incapacitated <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>him; so I
gave him an annuity of ten pounds, with the help of which he has
set up this little place here, and his daughter goes and sells
milk in the city, while her father manages his tap-room, as he
calls it, at home.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t well ask a gentleman of
your appearance to accompany me to so paltry a
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Harley,
interrupting him, &ldquo;I would much rather enter it than the
most celebrated tavern in town.&nbsp; To give to the necessitous
may sometimes be a weakness in the man; to encourage industry is
a duty in the citizen.&rdquo;&nbsp; They entered the house
accordingly.</p>
<p>On a table at the corner of the room lay a pack of cards,
loosely thrown together.&nbsp; The old gentleman reproved the man
of the house for encouraging so idle an amusement.&nbsp; Harley
attempted to defend him from the necessity of accommodating
himself to the humour of his guests, and taking up the cards,
began to shuffle them backwards and forwards in his hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay, I don&rsquo;t think cards so unpardonable an
amusement as some do,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;and now
and then, about this time of the evening, when my eyes begin to
fail me for my book, I divert myself with a game at piquet,
without finding my morals a bit relaxed by it.&nbsp; <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Do you play
piquet, sir?&rdquo; (to Harley.)&nbsp; Harley answered in the
affirmative; upon which the other proposed playing a pool at a
shilling the game, doubling the stakes; adding, that he never
played higher with anybody.</p>
<p>Harley&rsquo;s good nature could not refuse the benevolent old
man; and the younger stranger, though he at first pleaded prior
engagements, yet being earnestly solicited by his friend, at last
yielded to solicitation.</p>
<p>When they began to play, the old gentleman, somewhat to the
surprise of Harley, produced ten shillings to serve for markers
of his score.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had no change for the
beggar,&rdquo; said Harley to himself; &ldquo;but I can easily
account for it; it is curious to observe the affection that
inanimate things will create in us by a long acquaintance.&nbsp;
If I may judge from my own feelings, the old man would not part
with one of these counters for ten times its intrinsic value; it
even got the better of his benevolence!&nbsp; I, myself, have a
pair of old brass sleeve buttons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he was
interrupted by being told that the old gentleman had beat the
younger, and that it was his turn to take up the conqueror.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your game has been short,&rdquo; said Harley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I re-piqued <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>him,&rdquo; answered the old man, with joy sparkling in
his countenance.&nbsp; Harley wished to be re-piqued too, but he
was disappointed; for he had the same good fortune against his
opponent.&nbsp; Indeed, never did fortune, mutable as she is,
delight in mutability so much as at that moment.&nbsp; The
victory was so quick, and so constantly alternate, that the
stake, in a short time, amounted to no less a sum than &pound;12,
Harley&rsquo;s proportion of which was within half-a-guinea of
the money he had in his pocket.&nbsp; He had before proposed a
division, but the old gentleman opposed it with such a pleasant
warmth in his manner, that it was always over-ruled.&nbsp; Now,
however, he told them that he had an appointment with some
gentlemen, and it was within a few minutes of his hour.&nbsp; The
young stranger had gained one game, and was engaged in the second
with the other; they agreed, therefore, that the stake should be
divided, if the old gentleman won that: which was more than
probable, as his score was 90 to 35, and he was elder hand; but a
momentous re-pique decided it in favour of his adversary, who
seemed to enjoy his victory mingled with regret, for having won
too much, while his friend, with great ebullience of <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>passion, many
praises of his own good play, and many malediction&rsquo;s on the
power of chance, took up the cards, and threw them into the
fire.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FRUITS OF THE DEAD SEA.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> company he was engaged to meet
were assembled in Fleet Street.&nbsp; He had walked some time
along the Strand, amidst a crowd of those wretches who wait the
uncertain wages of prostitution, with ideas of pity suitable to
the scene around him and the feelings he possessed, and had got
as far as Somerset House, when one of them laid hold of his arm,
and, with a voice tremulous and faint, asked him for a pint of
wine, in a manner more supplicatory than is usual with those whom
the infamy of their profession has deprived of shame.&nbsp; He
turned round at the demand, and looked steadfastly on the person
who made it.</p>
<p>She was above the common size, and elegantly formed; her face
was thin and hollow, and showed <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the remains of tarnished
beauty.&nbsp; Her eyes were black, but had little of their lustre
left; her cheeks had some paint laid on without art, and
productive of no advantage to her complexion, which exhibited a
deadly paleness on the other parts of her face.</p>
<p>Harley stood in the attitude of hesitation; which she,
interpreting to her advantage, repeated her request, and
endeavoured to force a leer of invitation into her
countenance.&nbsp; He took her arm, and they walked on to one of
those obsequious taverns in the neighbourhood, where the dearness
of the wine is a discharge in full for the character of the
house.&nbsp; From what impulse he did this we do not mean to
enquire; as it has ever been against our nature to search for
motives where bad ones are to be found.&nbsp; They entered, and a
waiter showed them a room, and placed a bottle of claret on the
table.</p>
<p>Harley filled the lady&rsquo;s glass: which she had no sooner
tasted, than dropping it on the floor, and eagerly catching his
arm, her eye grew fixed, her lip assumed a clayey whiteness, and
she fell back lifeless in her chair.</p>
<p>Harley started from his seat, and, catching her <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>in his arms,
supported her from falling to the ground, looking wildly at the
door, as if he wanted to run for assistance, but durst not leave
the miserable creature.&nbsp; It was not till some minutes after
that it occurred to him to ring the bell, which at last, however,
he thought of, and rung with repeated violence even after the
waiter appeared.&nbsp; Luckily the waiter had his senses somewhat
more about him; and snatching up a bottle of water, which stood
on a buffet at the end of the room, he sprinkled it over the
hands and face of the dying figure before him.&nbsp; She began to
revive, and, with the assistance of some hartshorn drops, which
Harley now for the first time drew from his pocket, was able to
desire the waiter to bring her a crust of bread, of which she
swallowed some mouthfuls with the appearance of the keenest
hunger.&nbsp; The waiter withdrew: when turning to Harley,
sobbing at the same time, and shedding tears, &ldquo;I am sorry,
sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I should have given you so much
trouble; but you will pity me when I tell you that till now I
have not tasted a morsel these two days past.&rdquo;&mdash;He
fixed his eyes on hers&mdash;every circumstance but the last was
forgotten; and he took her <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>hand with as much respect as if she
had been a duchess.&nbsp; It was ever the privilege of misfortune
to be revered by him.&mdash;&ldquo;Two days!&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;and I have fared sumptuously every day!&rdquo;&mdash;He
was reaching to the bell; she understood his meaning, and
prevented him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg, sir,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;that you would give yourself no more trouble about a
wretch who does not wish to live; but, at present, I could not
eat a bit; my stomach even rose at the last mouthful of that
crust.&rdquo;&mdash;He offered to call a chair, saying that he
hoped a little rest would relieve her.&mdash;He had one
half-guinea left.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that at present I should be able to make you an offer of
no more than this paltry sum.&rdquo;&mdash;She burst into tears:
&ldquo;Your generosity, sir, is abused; to bestow it on me is to
take it from the virtuous.&nbsp; I have no title but misery to
plead: misery of my own procuring.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No more of
that,&rdquo; answered Harley; &ldquo;there is virtue in these
tears; let the fruit of them be virtue.&rdquo;&mdash;He rung, and
ordered a chair.&mdash;&ldquo;Though I am the vilest of
beings,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have not forgotten every
virtue; gratitude, I hope, I shall still have left, did I but
know who is my benefactor.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My name is
Harley.&rdquo;&mdash;<a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>&ldquo;Could I ever have an
opportunity?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You shall, and a glorious one
too! your future conduct&mdash;but I do not mean to reproach
you&mdash;if, I say&mdash;it will be the noblest reward&mdash;I
will do myself the pleasure of seeing you
again.&rdquo;&mdash;Here the waiter entered, and told them the
chair was at the door; the lady informed Harley of her lodgings,
and he promised to wait on her at ten next morning.</p>
<p>He led her to the chair, and returned to clear with the
waiter, without ever once reflecting that he had no money in his
pocket.&nbsp; He was ashamed to make an excuse; yet an excuse
must be made: he was beginning to frame one, when the waiter cut
him short by telling him that he could not run scores; but that,
if he would leave his watch, or any other pledge, it would be as
safe as if it lay in his pocket.&nbsp; Harley jumped at the
proposal, and pulling out his watch, delivered it into his hands
immediately, and having, for once, had the precaution to take a
note of the lodging he intended to visit next morning, sallied
forth with a blush of triumph on his face, without taking notice
of the sneer of the waiter, who, twirling the watch in his hand,
made him a profound bow at <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>the door, and whispered to a girl,
who stood in the passage, something, in which the word <span
class="GutSmall">CULLY</span> was honoured with a particular
emphasis.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HIS SKILL IN PHYSIOGNOMY IS
DOUBTED.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> he had been some time with
the company he had appointed to meet, and the last bottle was
called for, he first recollected that he would be again at a loss
how to discharge his share of the reckoning.&nbsp; He applied,
therefore, to one of them, with whom he was most intimate,
acknowledging that he had not a farthing of money about him; and,
upon being jocularly asked the reason, acquainted them with the
two adventures we have just now related.&nbsp; One of the company
asked him if the old man in Hyde Park did not wear a brownish
coat, with a narrow gold edging, and his companion an old green
frock, with a buff-coloured waistcoat.&nbsp; Upon Harley&rsquo;s
recollecting that they did, &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you may be <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>thankful you have come off so well; they are two as
noted sharpers, in their way, as any in town, and but
t&rsquo;other night took me in for a much larger sum.&nbsp; I had
some thoughts of applying to a justice, but one does not like to
be seen in those matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley answered, &ldquo;That he could not but fancy the
gentleman was mistaken, as he never saw a face promise more
honesty than that of the old man he had met
with.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;His face!&rdquo; said a grave-looking
man, when sat opposite to him, squirting the juice of his tobacco
obliquely into the grate.&nbsp; There was something very
emphatical in the action, for it was followed by a burst of
laughter round the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said
Harley, &ldquo;you are disposed to be merry; it may be as you
imagine, for I confess myself ignorant of the town; but there is
one thing which makes me hear the loss of my money with temper:
the young fellow who won it must have been miserably poor; I
observed him borrow money for the stake from his friend: he had
distress and hunger in his countenance: be his character what it
may, his necessities at least plead for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this
there was a louder laugh than before.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>said the lawyer, one of whose
conversations with Harley we have already recorded,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s a pretty fellow for you! to have heard him
talk some nights ago, as I did, you might have sworn he was a
saint; yet now he games with sharpers, and loses his money, and
is bubbled by a fine tale of the Dead Sea, and pawns his watch;
here are sanctified doings with a witness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young gentleman,&rdquo; said his friend on the other
side of the table, &ldquo;let me advise you to be a little more
cautious for the future; and as for faces&mdash;you may look into
them to know whether a man&rsquo;s nose be a long or a short
one.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HE KEEPS HIS APPOINTMENT.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last night&rsquo;s raillery of
his companions was recalled to his remembrance when he awoke, and
the colder homilies of prudence began to suggest some things
which were nowise favourable for a performance of his promise to
the unfortunate <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>female he had met with before.&nbsp; He rose, uncertain
of his purpose; but the torpor of such considerations was seldom
prevalent over the warmth of his nature.&nbsp; He walked some
turns backwards and forwards in his room; he recalled the languid
form of the fainting wretch to his mind; he wept at the
recollection of her tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though I am the vilest of
beings, I have not forgotten every virtue; gratitude, I hope, I
shall still have left.&rdquo;&mdash;He took a larger
stride&mdash;&ldquo;Powers of mercy that surround me!&rdquo;
cried he, &ldquo;do ye not smile upon deeds like these? to
calculate the chances of deception is too tedious a business for
the life of man!&rdquo;&mdash;The clock struck ten.&mdash;When he
was got down-stairs, he found that he had forgot the note of her
lodgings; he gnawed his lips at the delay: he was fairly on the
pavement, when he recollected having left his purse; he did but
just prevent himself from articulating an imprecation.&nbsp; He
rushed a second time up into his chamber.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
wretch I am!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;ere this time,
perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a perhaps not to be
borne;&mdash;two vibrations of a pendulum would have served him
to lock his bureau; but they could not be spared.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>When he
reached the house, and inquired for Miss Atkins (for that was the
lady&rsquo;s name), he was shown up three pair of stairs, into a
small room lighted by one narrow lattice, and patched round with
shreds of different-coloured paper.&nbsp; In the darkest corner
stood something like a bed, before which a tattered coverlet hung
by way of curtain.&nbsp; He had not waited long when she
appeared.&nbsp; Her face had the glister of new-washed tears on
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am ashamed, sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that
you should have taken this fresh piece of trouble about one so
little worthy of it; but, to the humane, I know there is a
pleasure in goodness for its own sake: if you have patience for
the recital of my story, it may palliate, though it cannot
excuse, my faults.&rdquo;&nbsp; Harley bowed, as a sign of
assent; and she began as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the daughter of an officer, whom a service of
forty years had advanced no higher than the rank of
captain.&nbsp; I have had hints from himself, and been informed
by others, that it was in some measure owing to those principles
of rigid honour, which it was his boast to possess, and which he
early inculcated on me, that he had been able to arrive at no
better station.&nbsp; My <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>mother died when I was a child: old
enough to grieve for her death, but incapable of remembering her
precepts.&nbsp; Though my father was doatingly fond of her, yet
there were some sentiments in which they materially differed: she
had been bred from her infancy in the strictest principles of
religion, and took the morality of her conduct from the motives
which an adherence to those principles suggested.&nbsp; My
father, who had been in the army from his youth, affixed an idea
of pusillanimity to that virtue, which was formed by the
doctrines, excited by the rewards, or guarded by the terrors of
revelation; his dashing idol was the honour of a soldier: a term
which he held in such reverence, that he used it for his most
sacred asseveration.&nbsp; When my mother died, I was some time
suffered to continue in those sentiments which her instructions
had produced; but soon after, though, from respect to her memory,
my father did not absolutely ridicule them, yet he showed, in his
discourse to others, so little regard to them, and at times
suggested to me motives of action so different, that I was soon
weaned from opinions which I began to consider as the dreams of
superstition, or the artful inventions of designing <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>hypocrisy.&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s books were left
behind at the different quarters we removed to, and my reading
was principally confined to plays, novels, and those poetical
descriptions of the beauty of virtue and honour, which the
circulating libraries easily afforded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was generally reckoned handsome, and the quickness
of my parts extolled by all our visitors, my father had a pride
in allowing me to the world.&nbsp; I was young, giddy, open to
adulation, and vain of those talents which acquired it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the last war, my father was reduced to half-pay;
with which we retired to a village in the country, which the
acquaintance of some genteel families who resided in it, and the
cheapness of living, particularly recommended.&nbsp; My father
rented a small house, with a piece of ground sufficient to keep a
horse for him, and a cow for the benefit of his family.&nbsp; An
old man servant managed his ground; while a maid, who had
formerly been my mother&rsquo;s, and had since been mine,
undertook the care of our little dairy: they were assisted in
each of their provinces by my father and me: and we passed our
time in a state of tranquillity, which he had always talked of
with <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>delight, and my train of reading had taught me to
admire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though I had never seen the polite circles of the
metropolis, the company my father had introduced me into had
given me a degree of good breeding, which soon discovered a
superiority over the young ladies of our village.&nbsp; I was
quoted as an example of politeness, and my company courted by
most of the considerable families in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst the houses where I was frequently invited was
Sir George Winbrooke&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He had two daughters nearly
of my age, with whom, though they had been bred up in those
maxims of vulgar doctrine which my superior understanding could
not but despise, yet as their good nature led them to an
imitation of my manners in everything else, I cultivated a
particular friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some months after our first acquaintance, Sir
George&rsquo;s eldest son came home from his travels.&nbsp; His
figure, his address, and conversation, were not unlike those warm
ideas of an accomplished man which my favourite novels had taught
me to form; and his sentiments on the article of religion were as
liberal as my own: when any of these happened <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>to be the
topic of our discourse, I, who before had been silent, from a
fear of being single in opposition, now kindled at the fire he
raised, and defended our mutual opinions with all the eloquence I
was mistress of.&nbsp; He would be respectfully attentive all the
while; and when I had ended, would raise his eyes from the
ground, look at me with a gaze of admiration, and express his
applause in the highest strain of encomium.&nbsp; This was an
incense the more pleasing, as I seldom or never had met with it
before; for the young gentlemen who visited Sir George were for
the most part of that athletic order, the pleasure of whose lives
is derived from fox-hunting: these are seldom solicitous to
please the women at all; or if they were, would never think of
applying their flattery to the mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winbrooke observed the weakness of my soul, and
took every occasion of improving the esteem he had gained.&nbsp;
He asked my opinion of every author, of every sentiment, with
that submissive diffidence, which showed an unlimited confidence
in my understanding.&nbsp; I saw myself revered, as a superior
being, by one whose judgment my vanity told me was not likely to
err: <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>preferred by him to all the other visitors of my sex,
whose fortunes and rank should have entitled them to a much
higher degree of notice: I saw their little jealousies at the
distinguished attention he paid me; it was gratitude, it was
pride, it was love!&nbsp; Love which had made too fatal a
progress in my heart, before any declaration on his part should
have warranted a return: but I interpreted every look of
attention, every expression of compliment, to the passion I
imagined him inspired with, and imputed to his sensibility that
silence which was the effect of art and design.&nbsp; At length,
however, he took an opportunity of declaring his love: he now
expressed himself in such ardent terms, that prudence might have
suspected their sincerity: but prudence is rarely found in the
situation I had been unguardedly led into; besides, that the
course of reading to which I had been accustomed, did not lead me
to conclude, that his expressions could be too warm to be
sincere: nor was I even alarmed at the manner in which he talked
of marriage, a subjection, he often hinted, to which genuine love
should scorn to be confined.&nbsp; The woman, he would often say,
who had merit like mine to fix his affection, could easily
command <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>it
for ever.&nbsp; That honour too which I revered, was often called
in to enforce his sentiments.&nbsp; I did not, however,
absolutely assent to them; but I found my regard for their
opposites diminish by degrees.&nbsp; If it is dangerous to be
convinced, it is dangerous to listen; for our reason is so much
of a machine, that it will not always be able to resist, when the
ear is perpetually assailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, Mr. Harley (for I tire you with a relation,
the catastrophe of which you will already have imagined), I fell
a prey to his artifices.&nbsp; He had not been able so thoroughly
to convert me, that my conscience was silent on the subject; but
he was so assiduous to give repeated proofs of unabated
affection, that I hushed its suggestions as they rose.&nbsp; The
world, however, I knew, was not to be silenced; and therefore I
took occasion to express my uneasiness to my seducer, and entreat
him, as he valued the peace of one to whom he professed such
attachment, to remove it by a marriage.&nbsp; He made excuse from
his dependence on the will of his father, but quieted my fears by
the promise of endeavouring to win his assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father had been some days absent on a visit to a
dying relation, from whom he had considerable <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>expectations.&nbsp; I was left at home, with no other
company than my books: my books I found were not now such
companions as they used to be; I was restless, melancholy,
unsatisfied with myself.&nbsp; But judge my situation when I
received a billet from Mr. Winbrooke informing me, that he had
sounded Sir George on the subject we had talked of, and found him
so averse to any match so unequal to his own rank and fortune,
that he was obliged, with whatever reluctance, to bid adieu to a
place, the remembrance of which should ever be dear to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read this letter a hundred times over.&nbsp; Alone,
helpless, conscious of guilt, and abandoned by every better
thought, my mind was one motley scene of terror, confusion, and
remorse.&nbsp; A thousand expedients suggested themselves, and a
thousand fears told me they would be vain: at last, in an agony
of despair, I packed up a few clothes, took what money and
trinkets were in the house, and set out for London, whither I
understood he was gone; pretending to my maid, that I had
received letters from my father requiring my immediate
attendance.&nbsp; I had no other companion than a boy, a servant
to the man from whom I <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>hired my horses.&nbsp; I arrived in
London within an hour of Mr. Winbrooke, and accidentally alighted
at the very inn where he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He started and turned pale when he saw me; but
recovered himself in time enough to make many new protestations
of regard, and beg me to make myself easy under a disappointment
which was equally afflicting to him.&nbsp; He procured me
lodgings, where I slept, or rather endeavoured to sleep, for that
night.&nbsp; Next morning I saw him again, he then mildly
observed on the imprudence of my precipitate flight from the
country, and proposed my removing to lodgings at another end of
the town, to elude the search of my father, till he should fall
upon some method of excusing my conduct to him, and reconciling
him to my return.&nbsp; We took a hackney-coach, and drove to the
house he mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was situated in a dirty lane, furnished with a
tawdry affectation of finery, with some old family pictures
hanging on walls which their own cobwebs would better have
suited.&nbsp; I was struck with a secret dread at entering, nor
was it lessened by the appearance of the landlady, who had that
look of selfish shrewdness, which, of all others, is the <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>most hateful
to those whose feelings are untinctured with the world.&nbsp; A
girl, who she told us was her niece, sat by her, playing on a
guitar, while herself was at work, with the assistance of
spectacles, and had a prayer-book with the leaves folded down in
several places, lying on the table before her.&nbsp; Perhaps,
sir, I tire you with my minuteness, but the place, and every
circumstance about it, is so impressed on my mind, that I shall
never forget it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dined that day with Mr. Winbrooke alone.&nbsp; He
lost by degrees that restraint which I perceived too well to hang
about him before, and, with his former gaiety and good humour,
repeated the flattering things which, though they had once been
fatal, I durst not now distrust.&nbsp; At last, taking my hand
and kissing it, &lsquo;It is thus,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that
love will last, while freedom is preserved; thus let us ever be
blessed, without the galling thought that we are tied to a
condition where we may cease to be so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I answered, &lsquo;That the world thought otherwise:
that it had certain ideas of good fame, which it was impossible
not to wish to maintain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The world,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is a tyrant,
they are slaves who obey it; let us be happy without the <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>pale of the
world.&nbsp; To-morrow I shall leave this quarter of it, for one
where the talkers of the world shall be foiled, and lose
us.&nbsp; Could not my Emily accompany me? my friend, my
companion, the mistress of my soul!&nbsp; Nay, do not look so,
Emily!&nbsp; Your father may grieve for a while, but your father
shall be taken care of; this bank-bill I intend as the comfort
for his daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could contain myself no longer: &lsquo;Wretch,&rsquo;
I exclaimed, &lsquo;dost thou imagine that my father&rsquo;s
heart could brook dependence on the destroyer of his child, and
tamely accept of a base equivalent for her honour and his
own?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Honour, my Emily,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is the
word of fools, or of those wiser men who cheat them.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a fantastic bauble that does not suit the gravity of
your father&rsquo;s age; but, whatever it is, I am afraid it can
never be perfectly restored to you: exchange the word then, and
let pleasure be your object now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At these words he clasped me in his arms, and pressed
his lips rudely to my bosom.&nbsp; I started from my seat.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Perfidious villain!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;who dar&rsquo;st
insult the weakness thou hast undone; were that father here, thy
coward soul would shrink <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>from the vengeance of his
honour!&nbsp; Cursed be that wretch who has deprived him of it!
oh doubly cursed, who has dragged on his hoary head the infamy
which should have crushed her own!&rsquo;&nbsp; I snatched a
knife which lay beside me, and would have plunged it in my
breast, but the monster prevented my purpose, and smiling with a
grin of barbarous insult&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I confess you are
rather too much in heroics for me; I am sorry we should differ
about trifles; but as I seem somehow to have offended you, I
would willingly remedy it by taking my leave.&nbsp; You have been
put to some foolish expense in this journey on my account; allow
me to reimburse you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So saying he laid a bank-bill, of what amount I had no
patience to see, upon the table.&nbsp; Shame, grief, and
indignation choked my utterance; unable to speak my wrongs, and
unable to bear them in silence, I fell in a swoon at his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened in the interval I cannot tell, but when I
came to myself I was in the arms of the landlady, with her niece
chafing my temples, and doing all in her power for my
recovery.&nbsp; She had much compassion in her countenance; the
old <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>woman
assumed the softest look she was capable of, and both endeavoured
to bring me comfort.&nbsp; They continued to show me many
civilities, and even the aunt began to be less disagreeable in my
sight.&nbsp; To the wretched, to the forlorn, as I was, small
offices of kindness are endearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meantime my money was far spent, nor did I attempt to
conceal my wants from their knowledge.&nbsp; I had frequent
thoughts of returning to my father; but the dread of a life of
scorn is insurmountable.&nbsp; I avoided, therefore, going abroad
when I had a chance of being seen by any former acquaintance, nor
indeed did my health for a great while permit it; and suffered
the old woman, at her own suggestion, to call me niece at home,
where we now and then saw (when they could prevail on me to leave
my room) one or two other elderly women, and sometimes a grave
business-like man, who showed great compassion for my
indisposition, and made me very obligingly an offer of a room at
his country-house for the recovery of my health.&nbsp; This offer
I did not chose to accept, but told my landlady, &lsquo;that I
should be glad to be employed in any way of business which my
skill in needlework could recommend me to, confessing, at the <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>same time,
that I was afraid I should scarce be able to pay her what I
already owed for board and lodging, and that for her other good
offices, I had nothing but thanks to give her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear child,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;do not
talk of paying; since I lost my own sweet girl&rsquo; (here she
wept), &lsquo;your very picture she was, Miss Emily, I have
nobody, except my niece, to whom I should leave any little thing
I have been able to save; you shall live with me, my dear; and I
have sometimes a little millinery work, in which, when you are
inclined to it, you may assist us.&nbsp; By the way, here are a
pair of ruffles we have just finished for that gentleman you saw
here at tea; a distant relation of mine, and a worthy man he
is.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas pity you refused the offer of an apartment
at his country house; my niece, you know, was to have accompanied
you, and you might have fancied yourself at home; a most sweet
place it is, and but a short mile beyond Hampstead.&nbsp; Who
knows, Miss Emily, what effect such a visit might have had!&nbsp;
If I had half your beauty I should not waste it pining after
e&rsquo;er a worthless fellow of them all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt my heart swell at her words; I would <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>have been
angry if I could, but I was in that stupid state which is not
easily awakened to anger: when I would have chid her the reproof
stuck in my throat; I could only weep!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her want of respect increased, as I had not spirit to
assert it.&nbsp; My work was now rather imposed than offered, and
I became a drudge for the bread I eat: but my dependence and
servility grew in proportion, and I was now in a situation which
could not make any extraordinary exertions to disengage itself
from either&mdash;I found myself with child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last the wretch, who had thus trained me to
destruction, hinted the purpose for which those means had been
used.&nbsp; I discovered her to be an artful procuress for the
pleasures of those who are men of decency to the world in the
midst of debauchery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I roused every spark of courage within me at the horrid
proposal.&nbsp; She treated my passion at first somewhat mildly,
but when I continued to exert it she resented it with insult, and
told me plainly that if I did not soon comply with her desires I
should pay her every farthing I owed, or rot in a jail for
life.&nbsp; I trembled at the thought; <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>still, however, I resisted her
importunities, and she put her threats in execution.&nbsp; I was
conveyed to prison, weak from my condition, weaker from that
struggle of grief and misery which for some time I had
suffered.&nbsp; A miscarriage was the consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amidst all the horrors of such a state, surrounded with
wretches totally callous, lost alike to humanity and to shame,
think, Mr. Harley, think what I endured; nor wonder that I at
last yielded to the solicitations of that miscreant I had seen at
her house, and sunk to the prostitution which he tempted.&nbsp;
But that was happiness compared to what I have suffered
since.&nbsp; He soon abandoned me to the common use of the town,
and I was cast among those miserable beings in whose society I
have since remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! did the daughters of virtue know our sufferings;
did they see our hearts torn with anguish amidst the affectation
of gaiety which our faces are obliged to assume! our bodies
tortured by disease, our minds with that consciousness which they
cannot lose!&nbsp; Did they know, did they think of this, Mr.
Harley!&nbsp; Their censures are just, but their pity perhaps
might <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>spare the wretches whom their justice should
condemn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night, but for an exertion of benevolence which
the infection of our infamy prevents even in the humane, had I
been thrust out from this miserable place which misfortune has
yet left me; exposed to the brutal insults of drunkenness, or
dragged by that justice which I could not bribe, to the
punishment which may correct, but, alas! can never amend the
abandoned objects of its terrors.&nbsp; From that, Mr. Harley,
your goodness has relieved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He beckoned with his hand: he would have stopped the mention
of his favours; but he could not speak, had it been to beg a
diadem.</p>
<p>She saw his tears; her fortitude began to fail at the sight,
when the voice of some stranger on the stairs awakened her
attention.&nbsp; She listened for a moment, then starting up,
exclaimed, &ldquo;Merciful God! my father&rsquo;s
voice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had scarce uttered the word, when the door burst open, and
a man entered in the garb of an officer.&nbsp; When he discovered
his daughter and Harley, he started back a few paces; his look
assumed a furious wildness! he laid his hand on <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>his
sword.&nbsp; The two objects of his wrath did not utter a
syllable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Villain,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;thou seest a father
who had once a daughter&rsquo;s honour to preserve; blasted as it
now is, behold him ready to avenge its loss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley had by this time some power of utterance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you will be a moment
calm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infamous coward!&rdquo; interrupted the other,
&ldquo;dost thou preach calmness to wrongs like mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;let me tell
you&rdquo;&mdash;the blood ran quicker to his cheek, his pulse
beat one, no more, and regained the temperament of
humanity&mdash;&ldquo;you are deceived, sir,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you are much deceived; but I forgive suspicions which your
misfortunes have justified: I would not wrong you, upon my soul I
would not, for the dearest gratification of a thousand worlds; my
heart bleeds for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His daughter was now prostrate at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;strike here a wretch,
whose misery cannot end but with that death she
deserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hair had fallen on her shoulders! her look <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>had the
horrid calmness of out-breathed despair!&nbsp; Her father would
have spoken; his lip quivered, his cheek grew pale, his eyes lost
the lightning of their fury! there was a reproach in them, but
with a mingling of pity.&nbsp; He turned them up to heaven, then
on his daughter.&nbsp; He laid his left hand on his heart, the
sword dropped from his right, he burst into tears.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE DISTRESSES OF A FATHER.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Harley</span> kneeled also at the side of
the unfortunate daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to entreat your
pardon for one whose offences have been already so signally
punished.&nbsp; I know, I feel, that those tears, wrung from the
heart of a father, are more dreadful to her than all the
punishments your sword could have inflicted: accept the
contrition of a child whom heaven has restored to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she not lost,&rdquo; answered he,
&ldquo;irrecoverably <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>lost?&nbsp; Damnation! a common
prostitute to the meanest ruffian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calmly, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;did you
know by what complicated misfortunes she had fallen to that
miserable state in which you now behold her, I should have no
need of words to excite your compassion.&nbsp; Think, sir, of
what once she was.&nbsp; Would you abandon her to the insults of
an unfeeling world, deny her opportunity of penitence, and cut
off the little comfort that still remains for your afflictions
and her own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to his
daughter; &ldquo;speak; I will hear thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The desperation that supported her was lost; she fell to the
ground, and bathed his feet with her tears.</p>
<p>Harley undertook her cause: he related the treacheries to
which she had fallen a sacrifice, and again solicited the
forgiveness of her father.&nbsp; He looked on her for some time
in silence; the pride of a soldier&rsquo;s honour checked for a
while the yearnings of his heart; but nature at last prevailed,
he fell on her neck and mingled his tears with hers.</p>
<p>Harley, who discovered from the dress of the <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>stranger
that he was just arrived from a journey, begged that they would
both remove to his lodgings, till he could procure others for
them.&nbsp; Atkins looked at him with some marks of
surprise.&nbsp; His daughter now first recovered the power of
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch as I am,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;yet there is
some gratitude due to the preserver of your child.&nbsp; See him
now before you.&nbsp; To him I owe my life, or at least the
comfort of imploring your forgiveness before I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, young gentleman,&rdquo; said Atkins,
&ldquo;I fear my passion wronged you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, never, sir,&rdquo; said Harley &ldquo;if it had,
your reconciliation to your daughter were an atonement a thousand
fold.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then repeated his request that he might be
allowed to conduct them to his lodgings, to which Mr. Atkins at
last consented.&nbsp; He took his daughter&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my Emily,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we can never,
never recover that happiness we have lost! but time may teach us
to remember our misfortunes with patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they arrived at the house where Harley lodged, he was
informed that the first floor was then vacant, and that the
gentleman and his <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>daughter might be accommodated there.&nbsp; While he
was upon his enquiry, Miss Atkins informed her father more
particularly what she owed to his benevolence.&nbsp; When he
turned into the room where they were Atkins ran and embraced
him;&mdash;begged him again to forgive the offence he had given
him, and made the warmest protestations of gratitude for his
favours.&nbsp; We would attempt to describe the joy which Harley
felt on this occasion, did it not occur to us that one half of
the world could not understand it though we did, and the other
half will, by this time, have understood it without any
description at all.</p>
<p>Miss Atkins now retired to her chamber, to take some rest from
the violence of the emotions she had suffered.&nbsp; When she was
gone, her father, addressing himself to Harley, said, &ldquo;You
have a right, sir, to be informed of the present situation of one
who owes so much to your compassion for his misfortunes.&nbsp; My
daughter I find has informed you what that was at the fatal
juncture when they began.&nbsp; Her distresses you have heard,
you have pitied as they deserved; with mine, perhaps, I cannot so
easily make you acquainted.&nbsp; You have a feeling heart, Mr.
Harley; I bless it <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>that it has saved my child; but you never were a
father, a father torn by that most dreadful of calamities, the
dishonour of a child he doated on!&nbsp; You have been already
informed of some of the circumstances of her elopement: I was
then from home, called by the death of a relation, who, though he
would never advance me a shilling on the utmost exigency in his
life-time, left me all the gleanings of his frugality at his
death.&nbsp; I would not write this intelligence to my daughter,
because I intended to be the bearer myself; and as soon as my
business would allow me, I set out on my return, winged with all
the haste of paternal affection.&nbsp; I fondly built those
schemes of future happiness, which present prosperity is ever
busy to suggest: my Emily was concerned in them all.&nbsp; As I
approached our little dwelling my heart throbbed with the
anticipation of joy and welcome.&nbsp; I imagined the cheering
fire, the blissful contentment of a frugal meal, made luxurious
by a daughter&rsquo;s smile, I painted to myself her surprise at
the tidings of our new-acquired riches, our fond disputes about
the disposal of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road was shortened by the dreams of happiness I
enjoyed, and it began to be dark as I <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>reached the house: I alighted from
my horse, and walked softly upstairs to the room we commonly sat
in.&nbsp; I was somewhat disappointed at not finding my daughter
there.&nbsp; I rung the bell; her maid appeared, and shewed no
small signs of wonder at the summons.&nbsp; She blessed herself
as she entered the room: I smiled at her surprise.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where is Miss Emily, sir?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Emily!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sir; she has been gone hence some days,
upon receipt of those letters you sent her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Letters!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sir, so she told me, and went off in all
haste that very night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood aghast as she spoke, but was able so far to
recollect myself, as to put on the affectation of calmness, and
telling her there was certainly some mistake in the affair,
desired her to leave me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she was gone, I threw myself into a chair, in that
state of uncertainty which is, of all others, the most
dreadful.&nbsp; The gay visions with which I had delighted
myself, vanished in an instant.&nbsp; I was tortured with tracing
back the same circle of doubt and disappointment.&nbsp; My <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>head grew
dizzy as I thought.&nbsp; I called the servant again, and asked
her a hundred questions, to no purpose; there was not room even
for conjecture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something at last arose in my mind, which we call Hope,
without knowing what it is.&nbsp; I wished myself deluded by it;
but it could not prevail over my returning fears.&nbsp; I rose
and walked through the room.&nbsp; My Emily&rsquo;s spinnet stood
at the end of it, open, with a book of music folded down at some
of my favourite lessons.&nbsp; I touched the keys; there was a
vibration in the sound that froze my blood; I looked around, and
methought the family pictures on the walls gazed on me with
compassion in their faces.&nbsp; I sat down again with an attempt
at more composure; I started at every creaking of the door, and
my ears rung with imaginary noises!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not remained long in this situation, when the
arrival of a friend, who had accidentally heard of my return, put
an end to my doubts, by the recital of my daughter&rsquo;s
dishonour.&nbsp; He told me he had his information from a young
gentleman, to whom Winbrooke had boasted of having seduced
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started from my seat, with broken curses on <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>my lips,
and without knowing whither I should pursue them, ordered my
servant to load my pistols and saddle my horses.&nbsp; My friend,
however, with great difficulty, persuaded me to compose myself
for that night, promising to accompany me on the morrow, to Sir
George Winbrooke&rsquo;s in quest of his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morrow came, after a night spent in a state little
distant from madness.&nbsp; We went as early as decency would
allow to Sir George&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He received me with
politeness, and indeed compassion, protested his abhorrence of
his son&rsquo;s conduct, and told me that he had set out some
days before for London, on which place he had procured a draft
for a large sum, on pretence of finishing his travels, but that
he had not heard from him since his departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not wait for any more, either of information or
comfort, but, against the united remonstrances of Sir George and
my friend, set out instantly for London, with a frantic
uncertainty of purpose; but there, all manner of search was in
vain.&nbsp; I could trace neither of them any farther than the
inn where they first put up on their arrival; and after some days
fruitless inquiry, returned <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>home destitute of every little hope
that had hitherto supported me.&nbsp; The journeys I had made,
the restless nights I had spent, above all, the perturbation of
my mind, had the effect which naturally might be expected&mdash;a
very dangerous fever was the consequence.&nbsp; From this,
however, contrary to the expectation of my physicians, I
recovered.&nbsp; It was now that I first felt something like
calmness of mind: probably from being reduced to a state which
could not produce the exertions of anguish or despair.&nbsp; A
stupid melancholy settled on my soul; I could endure to live with
an apathy of life; at times I forgot my resentment, and wept at
the remembrance of my child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such has been the tenor of my days since that fatal
moment when these misfortunes began, till yesterday, that I
received a letter from a friend in town, acquainting me of her
present situation.&nbsp; Could such tales as mine, Mr. Harley, be
sometimes suggested to the daughters of levity, did they but know
with what anxiety the heart of a parent flutters round the child
he loves, they would be less apt to construe into harshness that
delicate concern for their conduct, which they often complain of
as laying restraint upon things, to the <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>young, the
gay, and the thoughtless, seemingly harmless and
indifferent.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I fondly imagined that I needed
not even these common cautions! my Emily was the joy of my age,
and the pride of my soul!&nbsp; Those things are now no more,
they are lost for ever!&nbsp; Her death I could have born, but
the death of her honour has added obloquy and shame to that
sorrow which bends my grey hairs to the dust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke these last words, his voice trembled in his
throat; it was now lost in his tears.&nbsp; He sat with his face
half turned from Harley, as if he would have hid the sorrow which
he felt.&nbsp; Harley was in the same attitude himself; he durst
not meet his eye with a tear, but gathering his stifled breath,
&ldquo;Let me entreat you, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to hope
better things.&nbsp; The world is ever tyrannical; it warps our
sorrows to edge them with keener affliction.&nbsp; Let us not be
slaves to the names it affixes to motive or to action.&nbsp; I
know an ingenuous mind cannot help feeling when they sting.&nbsp;
But there are considerations by which it may be overcome.&nbsp;
Its fantastic ideas vanish as they rise; they teach us to look
beyond it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>A
FRAGMENT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SHOWING HIS SUCCESS WITH THE
BARONET.</span></h3>
<p>* * <span class="smcap">The</span> card he received was in the
politest style in which disappointment could be
communicated.&nbsp; The baronet &ldquo;was under a necessity of
giving up his application for Mr. Harley, as he was informed that
the lease was engaged for a gentleman who had long served His
Majesty in another capacity, and whose merit had entitled him to
the first lucrative thing that should be vacant.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Even Harley could not murmur at such a disposal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;some war-worn
officer, who, like poor Atkins, had been neglected from reasons
which merited the highest advancement; whose honour could not
stoop to solicit the preferment he deserved; perhaps, with a
family, taught the principles of delicacy, without the means of
supporting it; a wife and children&mdash;gracious heaven! whom my
wishes would have deprived of bread&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted in his reverie by some one tapping him on
the shoulder, and, on turning round, <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>he discovered it to be the very man
who had explained to him the condition of his gay companion at
Hyde Park Corner.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad to see you, sir,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;I believe we are fellows in
disappointment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Harley started, and said that he was
at a loss to understand him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pooh! you need not be
so shy,&rdquo; answered the other; &ldquo;every one for himself
is but fair, and I had much rather you had got it than the
rascally gauger.&rdquo;&nbsp; Harley still protested his
ignorance of what he meant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, the lease of
Bancroft Manor; had not you been applying for it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I confess I was,&rdquo; replied Harley; &ldquo;but I
cannot conceive how you should be interested in the
matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I was making interest for it
myself,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I think I had some
title.&nbsp; I voted for this same baronet at the last election,
and made some of my friends do so too; though I would not have
you imagine that I sold my vote.&nbsp; No, I scorn it, let me
tell you I scorn it; but I thought as how this man was staunch
and true, and I find he&rsquo;s but a double-faced fellow after
all, and speechifies in the House for any side he hopes to make
most by.&nbsp; Oh, how many fine speeches and squeezings by the
hand we had of him on the canvas!&nbsp; &lsquo;And if ever <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>I shall be
so happy as to have an opportunity of serving you.&rsquo;&nbsp; A
murrain on the smooth-tongued knave, and after all to get it for
this pimp of a gauger.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The gauger! there must
be some mistake,&rdquo; said Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;He writes me,
that it was engaged for one whose long
services&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Services!&rdquo; interrupted
the other; &ldquo;you shall hear.&nbsp; Services!&nbsp; Yes, his
sister arrived in town a few days ago, and is now sempstress to
the baronet.&nbsp; A plague on all rogues, says honest Sam
Wrightson.&nbsp; I shall but just drink damnation to them
to-night, in a crown&rsquo;s worth of Ashley&rsquo;s, and leave
London to-morrow by sun-rise.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall leave
it too,&rdquo; said Harley; and so he accordingly did.</p>
<p>In passing through Piccadilly, he had observed, on the window
of an inn, a notification of the departure of a stage-coach for a
place in his road homewards; in the way back to his lodgings, he
took a seat in it for his return.</p>
<h2><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HE LEAVES LONDON&mdash;CHARACTERS IN A
STAGE-COACH.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> company in the stage-coach
consisted of a grocer and his wife, who were going to pay a visit
to some of their country friends; a young officer, who took this
way of marching to quarters; a middle-aged gentlewoman, who had
been hired as housekeeper to some family in the country; and an
elderly, well-looking man, with a remarkable old-fashioned
periwig.</p>
<p>Harley, upon entering, discovered but one vacant seat, next
the grocer&rsquo;s wife, which, from his natural shyness of
temper, he made no scruple to occupy, however aware that riding
backwards always disagreed with him.</p>
<p>Though his inclination to physiognomy had met with some rubs
in the metropolis, he had not yet lost his attachment to that
science.&nbsp; He set himself, therefore, to examine, as usual,
the countenances of his companions.&nbsp; Here, indeed, he was
not long in doubt as to the preference; for besides <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>that the
elderly gentleman, who sat opposite to him, had features by
nature more expressive of good dispositions, there was something
in that periwig we mentioned, peculiarly attractive of
Harley&rsquo;s regard.</p>
<p>He had not been long employed in these speculations, when he
found himself attacked with that faintish sickness, which was the
natural consequence of his situation in the coach.&nbsp; The
paleness of his countenance was first observed by the
housekeeper, who immediately made offer of her smelling bottle,
which Harley, however, declined, telling at the same time the
cause of his uneasiness.&nbsp; The gentleman, on the opposite
side of the coach, now first turned his eye from the side
direction in which it had been fixed, and begged Harley to
exchange places with him, expressing his regret that he had not
made the proposal before.&nbsp; Harley thanked him, and, upon
being assured that both seats were alike to him, was about to
accept of his offer, when the young gentleman of the sword,
putting on an arch look, laid hold of the other&rsquo;s
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;So, my old boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I find
you have still some youthful blood about you, but, with your
leave, I will do myself the honour of sitting <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>by this
lady;&rdquo; and took his place accordingly.&nbsp; The grocer
stared him as full in the face as his own short neck would allow,
and his wife, who was a little, round-faced woman, with a great
deal of colour in her cheeks, drew up at the compliment that was
paid her, looking first at the officer, and then at the
housekeeper.</p>
<p>This incident was productive of some discourse; for before,
though there was sometimes a cough or a hem from the grocer, and
the officer now and then humm&rsquo;d a few notes of a song,
there had not a single word passed the lips of any of the
company.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grocer observed, how ill-convenient it was for people,
who could not be drove backwards, to travel in a stage.&nbsp;
This brought on a dissertation on stage-coaches in general, and
the pleasure of keeping a chay of one&rsquo;s own; which led to
another, on the great riches of Mr. Deputy Bearskin, who,
according to her, had once been of that industrious order of
youths who sweep the crossings of the streets for the conveniency
of passengers, but, by various fortunate accidents, had now
acquired an immense fortune, and kept his coach and a dozen
livery servants.&nbsp; All this afforded ample fund for <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>conversation, if conversation it might be called, that
was carried on solely by the before-mentioned lady, nobody
offering to interrupt her, except that the officer sometimes
signified his approbation by a variety of oaths, a sort of
phraseology in which he seemed extremely versant.&nbsp; She
appealed indeed, frequently, to her husband for the authenticity
of certain facts, of which the good man as often protested his
total ignorance; but as he was always called fool, or something
very like it, for his pains, he at last contrived to support the
credit of his wife without prejudice to his conscience, and
signified his assent by a noise not unlike the grunting of that
animal which in shape and fatness he somewhat resembled.</p>
<p>The housekeeper, and the old gentleman who sat next to Harley,
were now observed to be fast asleep, at which the lady, who had
been at such pains to entertain them, muttered some words of
displeasure, and, upon the officer&rsquo;s whispering to smoke
the old put, both she and her husband purs&rsquo;d up their
mouths into a contemptuous smile.&nbsp; Harley looked sternly on
the grocer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are come, sir,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to those years when you might have learned some reverence
for age.&nbsp; As <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>for this young man, who has so lately escaped from the
nursery, he may be allowed to divert himself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dam&rsquo;me, sir!&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;do you
call me young?&rdquo; striking up the front of his hat, and
stretching forward on his seat, till his face almost touched
Harley&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is probable, however, that he discovered
something there which tended to pacify him, for, on the ladies
entreating them not to quarrel, he very soon resumed his posture
and calmness together, and was rather less profuse of his oaths
during the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>It is possible the old gentleman had waked time enough to hear
the last part of this discourse; at least (whether from that
cause, or that he too was a physiognomist) he wore a look
remarkably complacent to Harley, who, on his part, shewed a
particular observance of him.&nbsp; Indeed, they had soon a
better opportunity of making their acquaintance, as the coach
arrived that night at the town where the officer&rsquo;s regiment
lay, and the places of destination of their other
fellow-travellers, it seems, were at no great distance, for, next
morning, the old gentleman and Harley were the only passengers
remaining.</p>
<p>When they left the inn in the morning, Harley, <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>pulling out
a little pocket-book, began to examine the contents, and make
some corrections with a pencil.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said
he, turning to his companion, &ldquo;is an amusement with which I
sometimes pass idle hours at an inn.&nbsp; These are quotations
from those humble poets, who trust their fame to the brittle
tenure of windows and drinking-glasses.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From
our inn,&rdquo; returned the gentleman, &ldquo;a stranger might
imagine that we were a nation of poets; machines, at least,
containing poetry, which the motion of a journey emptied of their
contents.&nbsp; Is it from the vanity of being thought geniuses,
or a mere mechanical imitation of the custom of others, that we
are tempted to scrawl rhyme upon such places?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether vanity is the cause of our becoming rhymesters
or not,&rdquo; answered Harley, &ldquo;it is a pretty certain
effect of it.&nbsp; An old man of my acquaintance, who deals in
apothegms, used to say that he had known few men without envy,
few wits without ill-nature, and no poet without vanity; and I
believe his remark is a pretty just one.&nbsp; Vanity has been
immemorially the charter of poets.&nbsp; In this, the ancients
were more honest than we are.&nbsp; The old poets frequently make
<a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>boastful
predictions of the immortality their works shall acquire them;
ours, in their dedications and prefatory discourses, employ much
eloquence to praise their patrons, and much seeming modesty to
condemn themselves, or at least to apologise for their
productions to the world.&nbsp; But this, in my opinion, is the
more assuming manner of the two; for of all the garbs I ever saw
Pride put on, that of her humility is to me the most
disgusting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is natural enough for a poet to be vain,&rdquo; said
the stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;The little worlds which he raises, the
inspiration which he claims, may easily be productive of
self-importance; though that inspiration is fabulous, it brings
on egotism, which is always the parent of vanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be supposed,&rdquo; answered Harley, &ldquo;that
inspiration of old was an article of religious faith; in modern
times it may be translated a propensity to compose; and I believe
it is not always most readily found where the poets have fixed
its residence, amidst groves and plains, and the scenes of
pastoral retirement.&nbsp; The mind may be there unbent from the
cares of the world, but it will frequently, at the same time, be
unnerved from any <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>great exertion.&nbsp; It will feel imperfect, and
wander without effort over the regions of reflection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is at least,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;one
advantage in the poetical inclination, that it is an incentive to
philanthropy.&nbsp; There is a certain poetic ground, on which a
man cannot tread without feelings that enlarge the heart: the
causes of human depravity vanish before the romantic enthusiasm
he professes, and many who are not able to reach the Parnassian
heights, may yet approach so near as to be bettered by the air of
the climate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always thought so,&rdquo; replied Harley;
&ldquo;but this is an argument with the prudent against it: they
urge the danger of unfitness for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I allow it,&rdquo; returned the other; &ldquo;but I
believe it is not always rightfully imputed to the bent for
poetry: that is only one effect of the common cause.&mdash;Jack,
says his father, is indeed no scholar; nor could all the
drubbings from his master ever bring him one step forward in his
accidence or syntax: but I intend him for a merchant.&mdash;Allow
the same indulgence to Tom.&mdash;Tom reads Virgil and Horace
when he should be casting accounts; <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>and but t&rsquo;other day he pawned
his great-coat for an edition of Shakespeare.&mdash;But Tom would
have been as he is, though Virgil and Horace had never been born,
though Shakespeare had died a link-boy; for his nurse will tell
you, that when he was a child, he broke his rattle, to discover
what it was that sounded within it; and burnt the sticks of his
go-cart, because he liked to see the sparkling of timber in the
fire.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis a sad case; but what is to be
done?&mdash;Why, Jack shall make a fortune, dine on venison, and
drink claret.&mdash;Ay, but Tom&mdash;Tom shall dine with his
brother, when his pride will let him; at other times, he shall
bless God over a half-pint of ale and a Welsh-rabbit; and both
shall go to heaven as they may.&mdash;That&rsquo;s a poor
prospect for Tom, says the father.&mdash;To go to heaven!&nbsp; I
cannot agree with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;we now-a-days
discourage the romantic turn a little too much.&nbsp; Our boys
are prudent too soon.&nbsp; Mistake me not, I do not mean to
blame them for want of levity or dissipation; but their pleasures
are those of hackneyed vice, blunted to every finer emotion by
the repetition of debauch; and their desire of pleasure is warped
to the desire of wealth, as the means of procuring <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>it.&nbsp;
The immense riches acquired by individuals have erected a
standard of ambition, destructive of private morals, and of
public virtue.&nbsp; The weaknesses of vice are left us; but the
most allowable of our failings we are taught to despise.&nbsp;
Love, the passion most natural to the sensibility of youth, has
lost the plaintive dignity he once possessed, for the unmeaning
simper of a dangling coxcomb; and the only serious concern, that
of a dowry, is settled, even amongst the beardless leaders of the
dancing-school.&nbsp; The Frivolous and the Interested (might a
satirist say) are the characteristical features of the age; they
are visible even in the essays of our philosophers.&nbsp; They
laugh at the pedantry of our fathers, who complained of the times
in which they lived; they are at pains to persuade us how much
those were deceived; they pride themselves in defending things as
they find them, and in exploding the barren sounds which had been
reared into motives for action.&nbsp; To this their style is
suited; and the manly tone of reason is exchanged for perpetual
efforts at sneer and ridicule.&nbsp; This I hold to be an
alarming crisis in the corruption of a state; when not only is
virtue declined, and vice prevailing, but when the praises <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>of virtue
are forgotten, and the infamy of vice unfelt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soon after arrived at the next inn upon the route of the
stage-coach, when the stranger told Harley, that his
brother&rsquo;s house, to which he was returning, lay at no great
distance, and he must therefore unwillingly bid him adieu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; said Harley, taking his hand,
&ldquo;to have some word to remember so much seeming worth by: my
name is Harley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall remember it,&rdquo; answered the old gentleman,
&ldquo;in my prayers; mine is Silton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Silton indeed it was!&nbsp; Ben Silton himself!&nbsp; Once
more, my honoured friend, farewell!&mdash;Born to be happy
without the world, to that peaceful happiness which the world has
not to bestow!&nbsp; Envy never scowled on thy life, nor hatred
smiled on thy grave.</p>
<h2><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HE MEETS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the stage-coach arrived at the
place of its destination, Harley began to consider how he should
proceed the remaining part of his journey.&nbsp; He was very
civilly accosted by the master of the inn, who offered to
accommodate him either with a post-chaise or horses, to any
distance he had a mind: but as he did things frequently in a way
different from what other people call natural, he refused these
offers, and set out immediately a-foot, having first put a spare
shirt in his pocket, and given directions for the forwarding of
his portmanteau.&nbsp; This was a method of travelling which he
was accustomed to take: it saved the trouble of provision for any
animal but himself, and left him at liberty to chose his
quarters, either at an inn, or at the first cottage in which he
saw a face he liked: nay, when he was not peculiarly attracted by
the reasonable creation, he would sometimes consort with a
species of inferior rank, and lay himself down to sleep by the
side of a rock, or on <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>the banks of a rivulet.&nbsp; He did
few things without a motive, but his motives were rather
eccentric: and the useful and expedient were terms which he held
to be very indefinite, and which therefore he did not always
apply to the sense in which they are commonly understood.</p>
<p>The sun was now in his decline, and the evening remarkably
serene, when he entered a hollow part of the road, which winded
between the surrounding banks, and seamed the sward in different
lines, as the choice of travellers had directed them to tread
it.&nbsp; It seemed to be little frequented now, for some of
those had partly recovered their former verdure.&nbsp; The scene
was such as induced Harley to stand and enjoy it; when, turning
round, his notice was attracted by an object, which the fixture
of his eye on the spot he walked had before prevented him from
observing.</p>
<p>An old man, who from his dress seemed to have been a soldier,
lay fast asleep on the ground; a knapsack rested on a stone at
his right hand, while his staff and brass-hilted sword were
crossed at his left.</p>
<p>Harley looked on him with the most earnest attention.&nbsp; He
was one of those figures which <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Salvator would have drawn; nor was
the surrounding scenery unlike the wildness of that
painter&rsquo;s back-grounds.&nbsp; The banks on each side were
covered with fantastic shrub-wood, and at a little distance, on
the top of one of them, stood a finger-post, to mark the
directions of two roads which diverged from the point where it
was placed.&nbsp; A rock, with some dangling wild flowers, jutted
out above where the soldier lay; on which grew the stump of a
large tree, white with age, and a single twisted branch shaded
his face as he slept.&nbsp; His face had the marks of manly
comeliness impaired by time; his forehead was not altogether
bald, but its hairs might have been numbered; while a few white
locks behind crossed the brown of his neck with a contrast the
most venerable to a mind like Harley&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
art old,&rdquo; said he to himself; &ldquo;but age has not
brought thee rest for its infirmities; I fear those silver hairs
have not found shelter from thy country, though that neck has
been bronzed in its service.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stranger
waked.&nbsp; He looked at Harley with the appearance of some
confusion: it was a pain the latter knew too well to think of
causing in another; he turned and went on.&nbsp; The old man
re-adjusted his knapsack, and followed <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>in one of
the tracks on the opposite side of the road.</p>
<p>When Harley heard the tread of his feet behind him, he could
not help stealing back a glance at his fellow-traveller.&nbsp; He
seemed to bend under the weight of his knapsack; he halted on his
walk, and one of his arms was supported by a sling, and lay
motionless across his breast.&nbsp; He had that steady look of
sorrow, which indicates that its owner has gazed upon his griefs
till he has forgotten to lament them; yet not without those
streaks of complacency which a good mind will sometimes throw
into the countenance, through all the incumbent load of its
depression.</p>
<p>He had now advanced nearer to Harley, and, with an uncertain
sort of voice, begged to know what it was o&rsquo;clock; &ldquo;I
fear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sleep has beguiled me of my time,
and I shall hardly have light enough left to carry me to the end
of my journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said Harley (who by this time found the
romantic enthusiasm rising within him) &ldquo;how far do you mean
to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a little way, sir,&rdquo; returned the other;
&ldquo;and indeed it is but a little way I can manage <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>now:
&rsquo;tis just four miles from the height to the village,
thither I am going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going there too,&rdquo; said Harley; &ldquo;we may
make the road shorter to each other.&nbsp; You seem to have
served your country, sir, to have served it hardly too;
&rsquo;tis a character I have the highest esteem for.&mdash;I
would not be impertinently inquisitive; but there is that in your
appearance which excites my curiosity to know something more of
you; in the meantime, suffer me to carry that
knapsack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man gazed on him; a tear stood in his eye!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Young gentleman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are too good;
may Heaven bless you for an old man&rsquo;s sake, who has nothing
but his blessing to give! but my knapsack is so familiar to my
shoulders, that I should walk the worse for wanting it; and it
would be troublesome to you, who have not been used to its
weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; answered Harley, &ldquo;I should
tread the lighter; it would be the most honourable badge I ever
wore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the stranger, who had looked earnestly
in Harley&rsquo;s face during the last part of his discourse,
&ldquo;is act your name Harley?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;I am ashamed to
say I have forgotten yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well have forgotten my face,&rdquo; said the
stranger;&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;tis a long time since you saw it;
but possibly you may remember something of old
Edwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edwards!&rdquo; cried Harley, &ldquo;oh!
heavens!&rdquo; and sprung to embrace him; &ldquo;let me clasp
those knees on which I have sat so often: Edwards!&mdash;I shall
never forget that fire-side, round which I have been so
happy!&nbsp; But where, where have you been? where is Jack? where
is your daughter?&nbsp; How has it fared with them, when fortune,
I fear, has been so unkind to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a long tale,&rdquo; replied Edwards;
&ldquo;but I will try to tell it you as we walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you were at school in the neighbourhood, you
remember me at South-hill: that farm had been possessed by my
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, which last was a
younger brother of that very man&rsquo;s ancestor, who is now
lord of the manor.&nbsp; I thought I managed it, as they had
done, with prudence; I paid my rent regularly as it became due,
and had always as much behind as gave bread to me and my
children.&nbsp; But my <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>last lease was out soon after you
left that part of the country; and the squire, who had lately got
a London-attorney for his steward, would not renew it, because,
he said, he did not chuse to have any farm under &pound;300 a
year value on his estate; but offered to give me the preference
on the same terms with another, if I chose to take the one he had
marked out, of which mine was a part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could I do, Mr. Harley?&nbsp; I feared the
undertaking was too great for me; yet to leave, at my age, the
house I had lived in from my cradle!&nbsp; I could not, Mr.
Harley, I could not; there was not a tree about it that I did not
look on as my father, my brother, or my child: so I even ran the
risk, and took the squire&rsquo;s offer of the whole.&nbsp; But
had soon reason to repent of my bargain; the steward had taken
care that my former farm should be the best land of the division:
I was obliged to hire more servants, and I could not have my eye
over them all; some unfavourable seasons followed one another,
and I found my affairs entangling on my hands.&nbsp; To add to my
distress, a considerable corn-factor turned bankrupt with a sum
of mine in his possession: I failed paying my rent so punctually
<a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>as I was
wont to do, and the same steward had my stock taken in execution
in a few days after.&nbsp; So, Mr. Harley, there was an end of my
prosperity.&nbsp; However, there was as much produced from the
sale of my effects as paid my debts and saved me from a jail: I
thank God I wronged no man, and the world could never charge me
with dishonesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you seen us, Mr. Harley, when we were turned out of
South-hill, I am sure you would have wept at the sight.&nbsp; You
remember old Trusty, my shag house-dog; I shall never forget it
while I live; the poor creature was blind with age, and could
scarce crawl after us to the door; he went however as far as the
gooseberry-bush that you may remember stood on the left side of
the yard; he was wont to bask in the sun there; when he had
reached that spot, he stopped; we went on: I called to him; he
wagged his tail, but did not stir: I called again; he lay down: I
whistled, and cried Trusty; he gave a short howl, and died!&nbsp;
I could have lain down and died too; but God gave me strength to
live for my children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man now paused a moment to take breath.&nbsp; He eyed
Harley&rsquo;s face; it was bathed <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>with tears: the story was grown
familiar to himself; he dropped one tear, and no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though I was poor,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;I was
not altogether without credit.&nbsp; A gentleman in the
neighbourhood, who had a small farm unoccupied at the time,
offered to let me have it, on giving security for the rent; which
I made shift to procure.&nbsp; It was a piece of ground which
required management to make anything of; but it was nearly within
the compass of my son&rsquo;s labour and my own.&nbsp; We exerted
all our industry to bring it into some heart.&nbsp; We began to
succeed tolerably and lived contented on its produce, when an
unlucky accident brought us under the displeasure of a
neighbouring justice of the peace, and broke all our
family-happiness again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son was a remarkable good shooter; he-had always
kept a pointer on our former farm, and thought no harm in doing
so now; when one day, having sprung a covey in our own ground,
the dog, of his own accord, followed them into the
justice&rsquo;s.&nbsp; My son laid down his gun, and went after
his dog to bring him back: the game-keeper, who had marked the
birds, came up, and seeing the pointer, shot him just as my son
approached.&nbsp; The creature <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>fell; my son ran up to him: he died
with a complaining sort of cry at his master&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp;
Jack could bear it no longer; but, flying at the game-keeper,
wrenched his gun out of his hand, and with the butt end of it,
felled him to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had scarce got home, when a constable came with a
warrant, and dragged him to prison; there he lay, for the
justices would not take bail, till he was tried at the
quarter-sessions for the assault and battery.&nbsp; His fine was
hard upon us to pay: we contrived however to live the worse for
it, and make up the loss by our frugality: but the justice was
not content with that punishment, and soon after had an
opportunity of punishing us indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An officer with press-orders came down to our county,
and having met with the justices, agreed that they should pitch
on a certain number, who could most easily be spared from the
county, of whom he would take care to clear it: my son&rsquo;s
name was in the justices&rsquo; list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas on a Christmas eve, and the birth-day too
of my son&rsquo;s little boy.&nbsp; The night was piercing cold,
and it blew a storm, with showers of hail and snow.&nbsp; We had
made up a cheering fire in an inner <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>room; I sat before it in my
wicker-chair; blessing providence, that had still left a shelter
for me and my children.&nbsp; My son&rsquo;s two little ones were
holding their gambols around us; my heart warmed at the sight: I
brought a bottle of my best ale, and all our misfortunes were
forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had long been our custom to play a game at blind
man&rsquo;s buff on that night, and it was not omitted now; so to
it we fell, I, and my son, and his wife, the daughter of a
neighbouring farmer, who happened to be with us at the time, the
two children, and an old maid servant, who had lived with me from
a child.&nbsp; The lot fell on my son to be blindfolded: we had
continued some time in our game, when he groped his way into an
outer room in pursuit of some of us, who, he imagined, had taken
shelter there; we kept snug in our places, and enjoyed his
mistake.&nbsp; He had not been long there, when he was suddenly
seized from behind; &lsquo;I shall have you now,&rsquo; said he,
and turned about.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall you so, master?&rsquo;
answered the ruffian, who had laid hold of him; &lsquo;we shall
make you play at another sort of game by and
by.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;At these words Harley started with a
convulsive sort of motion, and grasping Edwards&rsquo;s sword,
drew it half out of <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>the scabbard, with a look of the
most frantic wildness.&nbsp; Edwards gently replaced it in its
sheath, and went on with his relation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing these words in a strange voice, we all
rushed out to discover the cause; the room by this time was
almost full of the gang.&nbsp; My daughter-in-law fainted at the
sight; the maid and I ran to assist her, while my poor son
remained motionless, gazing by turns on his children and their
mother.&nbsp; We soon recovered her to life, and begged her to
retire and wait the issue of the affair; but she flew to her
husband, and clung round him in an agony of terror and grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the gang was one of a smoother aspect, whom, by his
dress, we discovered to be a serjeant of foot: he came up to me,
and told me, that my son had his choice of the sea or land
service, whispering at the same time that, if he chose the land,
he might get off, on procuring him another man, and paying a
certain sum for his freedom.&nbsp; The money we could just muster
up in the house, by the assistance of the maid, who produced, in
a green bag, all the little savings of her service; but the man
we could not expect to find.&nbsp; My daughter-in-law gazed upon
her children with a look of the <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>wildest despair: &lsquo;My poor
infants!&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;your father is forced from you;
who shall now labour for your bread? or must your mother beg for
herself and you?&rsquo;&nbsp; I prayed her to be patient; but
comfort I had none to give her.&nbsp; At last, calling the
serjeant aside, I asked him, &lsquo;If I was too old to be
accepted in place of my son?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;you are rather old to be sure, but yet the money may do
much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put the money in his hand, and coming back to my
children, &lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you are free; live
to give your wife and these little ones bread; I will go, my
child, in your stead; I have but little life to lose, and if I
staid, I should add one to the wretches you left
behind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied my son, &lsquo;I am not that
coward you imagine me; heaven forbid that my father&rsquo;s grey
hairs should be so exposed, while I sat idle at home; I am young
and able to endure much, and God will take care of you and my
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I will put an end to
this matter, you have never hitherto disobeyed me; I will not be
contradicted in this; stay at home, I charge you, and, for my
sake, be kind to my children.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;Our parting, Mr. Harley, I cannot describe to
you; it was the first time we ever had parted: the very
press-gang could scarce keep from tears; but the serjeant, who
had seemed the softest before, was now the least moved of them
all.&nbsp; He conducted me to a party of new-raised recruits, who
lay at a village in the neighbourhood; and we soon after joined
the regiment.&nbsp; I had not been long with it when we were
ordered to the East Indies, where I was soon made a serjeant, and
might have picked up some money, if my heart had been as hard as
some others were; but my nature was never of that kind, that
could think of getting rich at the expense of my conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst our prisoners was an old Indian, whom some of
our officers supposed to have a treasure hidden somewhere; which
is no uncommon practice in that country.&nbsp; They pressed him
to discover it.&nbsp; He declared he had none, but that would not
satisfy them, so they ordered him to be tied to a stake, and
suffer fifty lashes every morning till he should learn to speak
out, as they said.&nbsp; Oh! Mr. Harley, had you seen him, as I
did, with his hands bound behind him, suffering in silence, while
the big drops trickled down his <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>shrivelled cheeks and wet his grey
beard, which some of the inhuman soldiers plucked in scorn!&nbsp;
I could not bear it, I could not for my soul, and one morning,
when the rest of the guard were out of the way, I found means to
let him escape.&nbsp; I was tried by a court-martial for
negligence of my post, and ordered, in compassion of my age, and
having got this wound in my arm and that in my leg in the
service, only to suffer three hundred lashes and be turned out of
the regiment; but my sentence was mitigated as to the lashes, and
I had only two hundred.&nbsp; When I had suffered these I was
turned out of the camp, and had betwixt three and four hundred
miles to travel before I could reach a sea-port, without guide to
conduct me, or money to buy me provisions by the way.&nbsp; I set
out, however, resolved to walk as far as I could, and then to lay
myself down and die.&nbsp; But I had scarce gone a mile when I
was met by the Indian whom I had delivered.&nbsp; He pressed me
in his arms, and kissed the marks of the lashes on my back a
thousand times; he led me to a little hut, where some friend of
his dwelt, and after I was recovered of my wounds conducted me so
far on my journey himself, and sent another Indian to <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>guide me
through the rest.&nbsp; When we parted he pulled out a purse with
two hundred pieces of gold in it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take this,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;my dear preserver, it is all I have been able to
procure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begged him not to bring himself to poverty for my
sake, who should probably have no need of it long, but he
insisted on my accepting it.&nbsp; He embraced me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are an Englishman,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but the
Great Spirit has given you an Indian heart, may He bear up the
weight of your old age, and blunt the arrow that brings it
rest!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We parted, and not long after I made shift to get my
passage to England.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but about a week since I
landed, and I am going to end my days in the arms of my
son.&nbsp; This sum may be of use to him and his children,
&rsquo;tis all the value I put upon it.&nbsp; I thank Heaven I
never was covetous of wealth; I never had much, but was always so
happy as to be content with my little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Edwards had ended his relation, Harley stood a while
looking at him in silence; at last he pressed him in his arms,
and when he had given vent to the fulness of his heart by a
shower of tears, &ldquo;Edwards,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let me
hold thee to my bosom, let me imprint the virtue of thy
sufferings <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>on my soul.&nbsp; Come, my honoured veteran! let me
endeavour to soften the last days of a life, worn out in the
service of humanity; call me also thy son, and let me cherish
thee as a father.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edwards, from whom the recollection of his own suffering had
scarced forced a tear, now blubbered like a boy; he could not
speak his gratitude, but by some short exclamations of blessings
upon Harley.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HE MISSES AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.&mdash;AN
ADVENTURE CONSEQUENT UPON IT.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> they had arrived within a
little way of the village they journeyed to, Harley stopped
short, and looked steadfastly on the mouldering walls of a ruined
house that stood on the road side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
heavens!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what do I see: silent, unroofed,
and desolate!&nbsp; Are all thy gay tenants gone? do I hear their
hum no more Edwards, look there, look there? the scene of my
infant joys, my earliest friendships, laid waste and
ruinous!&nbsp; <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>That was the very school where I was boarded when you
were at South-hill; &rsquo;tis but a twelve-month since I saw it
standing, and its benches filled with cherubs: that opposite side
of the road was the green on which they sported; see it now
ploughed up!&nbsp; I would have given fifty times its value to
have saved it from the sacrilege of that plough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear sir,&rdquo; replied Edwards, &ldquo;perhaps they
have left it from choice, and may have got another spot as
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cannot,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;they cannot; I
shall never see the sward covered with its daisies, nor pressed
by the dance of the dear innocents: I shall never see that stump
decked with the garlands which their little hands had
gathered.&nbsp; These two long stones, which now lie at the foot
of it, were once the supports of a hut I myself assisted to rear:
I have sat on the sods within it, when we had spread our banquet
of apples before us, and been more blessed&mdash;Oh!&nbsp;
Edwards, infinitely more blessed, than ever I shall be
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a woman passed them on the road, and discovered some
signs of wonder at the attitude of Harley, who stood, with his
hands <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>folded together, looking with a moistened eye on the
fallen pillars of the hut.&nbsp; He was too much entranced in
thought to observe her at all, but Edwards, civilly accosting
her, desired to know if that had not been the school-house, and
how it came into the condition in which they now saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alack a day!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it was the
school-house indeed; but to be sure, sir, the squire has pulled
it down because it stood in the way of his prospects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! how! prospects! pulled down!&rdquo; cried
Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure, sir; and the green, where the children
used to play, he has ploughed up, because, he said, they hurt his
fence on the other side of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curses on his narrow heart,&rdquo; cried Harley,
&ldquo;that could violate a right so sacred!&nbsp; Heaven blast
the wretch!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And from his derogate body never spring<br
/>
A babe to honour him!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I need not, Edwards, I need not&rdquo; (recovering himself
a little), &ldquo;he is cursed enough already: to him the noblest
source of happiness is denied, and the cares of his sordid soul
shall gnaw it, while <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>thou sittest over a brown crust,
smiling on those mangled limbs that have saved thy son and his
children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want anything with the school-mistress,
sir,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;I can show you the way to her
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed her without knowing whither he went.</p>
<p>They stopped at the door of a snug habitation, where sat an
elderly woman with a boy and a girl before her, each of whom held
a supper of bread and milk in their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, sir, is the school-mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;was not an old
venerable man school-master here some time ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, he was, poor man; the loss of his former
school-house, I believe, broke his heart, for he died soon after
it was taken down, and as another has not yet been found, I have
that charge in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this boy and girl, I presume, are your
pupils?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir; they are poor orphans, put under my care by
the parish, and more promising children I never saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>&ldquo;Orphans?&rdquo; said Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, of honest creditable parents as any in the
parish, and it is a shame for some folks to forget their
relations at a time when they have most need to remember
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;let us never forget
that we are all relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their father, sir,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;was a
farmer here in the neighbourhood, and a sober industrious man he
was; but nobody can help misfortunes: what with bad crops, and
bad debts, which are worse, his affairs went to wreck, and both
he and his wife died of broken hearts.&nbsp; And a sweet couple
they were, sir; there was not a properer man to look on in the
county than John Edwards, and so indeed were all the
Edwardses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Edwardses?&rdquo; cried the old soldier
hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Edwardses of South-hill, and a worthy family they
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;South-hill!&rdquo; said he, in a languid voice, and
fell back into the arms of the astonished Harley.&nbsp; The
school-mistress ran for some water&mdash;and a smelling-bottle,
with the assistance of which they <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>soon recovered the unfortunate
Edwards.&nbsp; He stared wildly for some time, then folding his
orphan grandchildren in his arms,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my children, my children,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;have I found you thus?&nbsp; My poor Jack, art thou
gone?&nbsp; I thought thou shouldst have carried thy
father&rsquo;s grey hairs to the grave! and these little
ones&rdquo;&mdash;his tears choked his utterance, and he fell
again on the necks of the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear old man,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;Providence
has sent you to relieve them; it will bless me if I can be the
means of assisting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, sir,&rdquo; answered the boy;
&ldquo;father, when he was a-dying, bade God bless us, and prayed
that if grandfather lived he might send him to support
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they lay my boy?&rdquo; said Edwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Old Churchyard,&rdquo; replied the woman,
&ldquo;hard by his mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will show it you,&rdquo; answered the boy, &ldquo;for
I have wept over it many a time when first I came amongst strange
folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the old man&rsquo;s hand, Harley laid hold of his
sister&rsquo;s, and they walked in silence to the churchyard.</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>There
was an old stone, with the corner broken off, and some letters,
half-covered with moss, to denote the names of the dead: there
was a cyphered R. E. plainer than the rest; it was the tomb they
sought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, grandfather,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>Edwards gazed upon it without uttering a word: the girl, who
had only sighed before, now wept outright; her brother sobbed,
but he stifled his sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told sister,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that she
should not take it so to heart; she can knit already, and I shall
soon be able to dig, we shall not starve, sister, indeed we shall
not, nor shall grandfather neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl cried afresh; Harley kissed off her tears as they
flowed, and wept between every kiss.</p>
<h2><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HE RETURNS HOME.&mdash;A DESCRIPTION OF
HIS RETINUE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with some difficulty that
Harley prevailed on the old man to leave the spot where the
remains of his son were laid.&nbsp; At last, with the assistance
of the school-mistress, he prevailed; and she accommodated
Edwards and him with beds in her house, there being nothing like
an inn nearer than the distance of some miles.</p>
<p>In the morning Harley persuaded Edwards to come with the
children to his house, which was distant but a short day&rsquo;s
journey.&nbsp; The boy walked in his grandfather&rsquo;s hand;
and the name of Edwards procured him a neighbouring
farmer&rsquo;s horse, on which a servant mounted, with the girl
on a pillow before him.</p>
<p>With this train Harley returned to the abode of his fathers:
and we cannot but think, that his enjoyment was as great as if he
had arrived from the tour of Europe with a Swiss valet for his
companion, and half a dozen snuff-boxes, with invisible <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>hinges, in
his pocket.&nbsp; But we take our ideas from sounds which folly
has invented; Fashion, Bon ton, and Vert&ugrave;, are the names
of certain idols, to which we sacrifice the genuine pleasures of
the soul: in this world of semblance, we are contented with
personating happiness; to feel it is an art beyond us.</p>
<p>It was otherwise with Harley; he ran upstairs to his aunt with
the history of his fellow-travellers glowing on his lips.&nbsp;
His aunt was an economist; but she knew the pleasure of doing
charitable things, and withal was fond of her nephew, and
solicitous to oblige him.&nbsp; She received old Edwards
therefore with a look of more complacency than is perhaps natural
to maiden ladies of three-score, and was remarkably attentive to
his grandchildren: she roasted apples with her own hands for
their supper, and made up a little bed beside her own for the
girl.&nbsp; Edwards made some attempts towards an acknowledgment
for these favours; but his young friend stopped them in their
beginnings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whosoever receiveth any of these children,&rdquo; said
his aunt; for her acquaintance with her Bible was habitual.</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Early
next morning Harley stole into the room where Edwards lay: he
expected to have found him a-bed, but in this he was mistaken:
the old man had risen, and was leaning over his sleeping
grandson, with the tears flowing down his cheeks.&nbsp; At first
he did not perceive Harley; when he did, he endeavoured to hide
his grief, and crossing his eyes with his hand expressed his
surprise at seeing him so early astir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of you,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;and
your children: I learned last night that a small farm of mine in
the neighbourhood is now vacant: if you will occupy it I shall
gain a good neighbour and be able in some measure to repay the
notice you took of me when a boy, and as the furniture of the
house is mine, it will be so much trouble saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edwards&rsquo;s tears gushed afresh, and Harley led him to see
the place he intended for him.</p>
<p>The house upon this farm was indeed little better than a hut;
its situation, however, was pleasant, and Edwards, assisted by
the beneficence of Harley, set about improving its neatness and
convenience.&nbsp; He staked out a piece of the green before for
a garden, and Peter, who acted in Harley&rsquo;s <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>family as
valet, butler, and gardener, had orders to furnish him with
parcels of the different seeds he chose to sow in it.&nbsp; I
have seen his master at work in this little spot with his coat
off, and his dibble in his hand: it was a scene of tranquil
virtue to have stopped an angel on his errands of mercy!&nbsp;
Harley had contrived to lead a little bubbling brook through a
green walk in the middle of the ground, upon which he had erected
a mill in miniature for the diversion of Edwards&rsquo;s infant
grandson, and made shift in its construction to introduce a
pliant bit of wood that answered with its fairy clack to the
murmuring of the rill that turned it.&nbsp; I have seen him
stand, listening to these mingled sounds, with his eye fixed on
the boy, and the smile of conscious satisfaction on his cheek,
while the old man, with a look half turned to Harley and half to
heaven, breathed an ejaculation of gratitude and piety.</p>
<p>Father of mercies!&nbsp; I also would thank thee that not only
hast thou assigned eternal rewards to virtue, but that, even in
this bad world, the lines of our duty and our happiness are so
frequently woven together.</p>
<h3><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>A
FRAGMENT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MAN OF FEELING TALKS OF WHAT HE DOES
NOT UNDERSTAND.&mdash;AN INCIDENT.</span></h3>
<p>* * * * &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Edwards</span>,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I have a proper regard for the prosperity of my
country: every native of it appropriates to himself some share of
the power, or the fame, which, as a nation, it acquires, but I
cannot throw off the man so much as to rejoice at our conquests
in India.&nbsp; You tell me of immense territories subject to the
English: I cannot think of their possessions without being led to
inquire by what right they possess them.&nbsp; They came there as
traders, bartering the commodities they brought for others which
their purchasers could spare; and however great their profits
were, they were then equitable.&nbsp; But what title have the
subjects of another kingdom to establish an empire in India? to
give laws to a country where the inhabitants received them on the
terms of friendly commerce?&nbsp; You say they are happier under
our regulations than the tyranny <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>of their own petty princes.&nbsp; I
must doubt it, from the conduct of those by whom these
regulations have been made.&nbsp; They have drained the
treasuries of Nabobs, who must fill them by oppressing the
industry of their subjects.&nbsp; Nor is this to be wondered at,
when we consider the motive upon which those gentlemen do not
deny their going to India.&nbsp; The fame of conquest, barbarous
as that motive is, is but a secondary consideration: there are
certain stations in wealth to which the warriors of the East
aspire.&nbsp; It is there, indeed, where the wishes of their
friends assign them eminence, where the question of their country
is pointed at their return.&nbsp; When shall I see a commander
return from India in the pride of honourable poverty?&nbsp; You
describe the victories they have gained; they are sullied by the
cause in which they fought: you enumerate the spoils of those
victories; they are covered with the blood of the vanquished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you tell me of some conqueror giving peace and
happiness to the conquered? did he accept the gifts of their
princes to use them for the comfort of those whose fathers, sons,
or husbands, fell in battle? did he use his power to gain <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>security
and freedom to the regions of oppression and slavery? did he
endear the British name by examples of generosity, which the most
barbarous or most depraved are rarely able to resist? did he
return with the consciousness of duty discharged to his country,
and humanity to his fellow-creatures? did he return with no lace
on his coat, no slaves in his retinue, no chariot at his door,
and no burgundy at his table?&mdash;these were laurels which
princes might envy&mdash;which an honest man would not
condemn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your maxims, Mr. Harley, are certainly right,&rdquo;
said Edwards.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not capable of arguing with you;
but I imagine there are great temptations in a great degree of
riches, which it is no easy matter to resist: those a poor man
like me cannot describe, because he never knew them; and perhaps
I have reason to bless God that I never did; for then, it is
likely, I should have withstood them no better than my
neighbours.&nbsp; For you know, sir, that it is not the fashion
now, as it was in former times, that I have read of in books,
when your great generals died so poor, that they did not leave
wherewithal to buy them a coffin; and people thought the better
of their <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>memories for it: if they did so now-a-days, I question
if any body, except yourself, and some few like you, would thank
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; replied Harley, &ldquo;that there is
so much truth in what you say; but however the general current of
opinion may point, the feelings are not yet lost that applaud
benevolence, and censure inhumanity.&nbsp; Let us endeavour to
strengthen them in ourselves; and we, who live sequestered from
the noise of the multitude, have better opportunities of
listening undisturbed to their voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They now approached the little dwelling of Edwards.&nbsp; A
maid-servant, whom he had hired to assist him in the care of his
grandchildren met them a little way from the house: &ldquo;There
is a young lady within with the children,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
Edwards expressed his surprise at the visit: it was however not
the less true; and we mean to account for it.</p>
<p>This young lady then was no other than Miss Walton.&nbsp; She
had heard the old man&rsquo;s history from Harley, as we have
already related it.&nbsp; Curiosity, or some other motive, made
her desirous to see his grandchildren; this she had an
opportunity <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>of gratifying soon, the children, in some of their
walks, having strolled as far as her father&rsquo;s avenue.&nbsp;
She put several questions to both; she was delighted with the
simplicity of their answers, and promised, that if they continued
to be good children, and do as their grandfather bid them, she
would soon see them again, and bring some present or other for
their reward.&nbsp; This promise she had performed now: she came
attended only by her maid, and brought with her a complete suit
of green for the boy, and a chintz gown, a cap, and a suit of
ribbons, for his sister.&nbsp; She had time enough, with her
maid&rsquo;s assistance, to equip them in their new habiliments
before Harley and Edwards returned.&nbsp; The boy heard his
grandfather&rsquo;s voice, and, with that silent joy which his
present finery inspired, ran to the door to meet him: putting one
hand in his, with the other pointed to his sister,
&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what Miss Walton has brought
us!&rdquo;&mdash;Edwards gazed on them.&nbsp; Harley fixed his
eyes on Miss Walton; her&rsquo;s were turned to the
ground;&mdash;in Edwards&rsquo;s was a beamy moisture.&mdash;He
folded his hands together&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot speak, young
lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neither
could Harley.&nbsp; <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>There were a thousand sentiments;
but they gushed so impetuously on his heart, that he could not
utter a syllable. * * * *</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XL.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MAN OF FEELING JEALOUS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> desire of communicating
knowledge or intelligence, is an argument with those who hold
that man is naturally a social animal.&nbsp; It is indeed one of
the earliest propensities we discover; but it may be doubted
whether the pleasure (for pleasure there certainly is) arising
from it be not often more selfish than social: for we frequently
observe the tidings of Ill communicated as eagerly as the
annunciation of Good.&nbsp; Is it that we delight in observing
the effects of the stronger passions? for we are all philosophers
in this respect; and it is perhaps amongst the spectators at
Tyburn that the most genuine are to be found.</p>
<p>Was it from this motive that Peter came one morning into his
master&rsquo;s room with a meaning face <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>of
recital?&nbsp; His master indeed did not at first observe it; for
he was sitting with one shoe buckled, delineating portraits in
the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have brushed those clothes, sir, as you
ordered me.&rdquo;&mdash;Harley nodded his head but Peter
observed that his hat wanted brushing too: his master nodded
again.&nbsp; At last Peter bethought him that the fire needed
stirring; and taking up the poker, demolished the turban&rsquo;d
head of a Saracen, while his master was seeking out a body for
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The morning is main cold, sir,&rdquo; said
Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
sir; I have been as far as Tom Dowson&rsquo;s to fetch some
barberries he had picked for Mrs. Margery.&nbsp; There was a rare
junketting last night at Thomas&rsquo;s among Sir Harry
Benson&rsquo;s servants; he lay at Squire Walton&rsquo;s, but he
would not suffer his servants to trouble the family: so, to be
sure, they were all at Tom&rsquo;s, and had a fiddle, and a hot
supper in the big room where the justices meet about the
destroying of hares and partridges, and them things; and
Tom&rsquo;s eyes looked so red and so bleared when I called him
to get the barberries:&mdash;And I hear as how Sir Harry is going
to be married to Miss Walton.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;How!&nbsp; Miss
Walton married!&rdquo; said Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, it <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>mayn&rsquo;t be true, sir, for all that; but
Tom&rsquo;s wife told it me, and to be sure the servants told
her, and their master told them, as I guess, sir; but it
mayn&rsquo;t be true for all that, as I said
before.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Have done with your idle
information,&rdquo; said Harley:&mdash;&ldquo;Is my aunt come
down into the parlour to breakfast?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
sir.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;ll be with her
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Peter was gone, he stood with his eyes fixed on the
ground, and the last words of his intelligence vibrating in his
ears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Walton married!&rdquo; he
sighed&mdash;and walked down stairs, with his shoe as it was, and
the buckle in his hand.&nbsp; His aunt, however, was pretty well
accustomed to those appearances of absence; besides, that the
natural gravity of her temper, which was commonly called into
exertion by the care of her household concerns, was such as not
easily to be discomposed by any circumstance of accidental
impropriety.&nbsp; She too had been informed of the intended
match between Sir Harry Benson and Miss Walton.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have been thinking,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that they are distant
relations: for the great-grandfather of this Sir Harry Benson,
who was knight of the shire in the reign of Charles the <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>First, and
one of the cavaliers of those times, was married to a daughter of
the Walton family.&rdquo;&nbsp; Harley answered drily, that it
might be so; but that he never troubled himself about those
matters.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are to
blame, nephew, for not knowing a little more of them: before I
was near your age I had sewed the pedigree of our family in a set
of chair-bottoms, that were made a present of to my grandmother,
who was a very notable woman, and had a proper regard for
gentility, I&rsquo;ll assure you; but now-a-days it is money, not
birth, that makes people respected; the more shame for the
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley was in no very good humour for entering into a
discussion of this question; but he always entertained so much
filial respect for his aunt, as to attend to her discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We blame the pride of the rich,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but are not we ashamed of our poverty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, one would not choose,&rdquo; replied his aunt,
&ldquo;to make a much worse figure than one&rsquo;s neighbours;
but, as I was saying before, the times (as my friend, Mrs.
Dorothy Walton, observes) are shamefully degenerated in this
respect.&nbsp; There was but t&rsquo;other day at Mr.
Walton&rsquo;s, that fat fellow&rsquo;s <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>daughter,
the London merchant, as he calls himself, though I have heard
that he was little better than the keeper of a chandler&rsquo;s
shop.&nbsp; We were leaving the gentlemen to go to tea.&nbsp; She
had a hoop, forsooth, as large and as stiff&mdash;and it showed a
pair of bandy legs, as thick as two&mdash;I was nearer the door
by an apron&rsquo;s length, and the pert hussy brushed by me, as
who should say, Make way for your betters, and with one of her
London bobs&mdash;but Mrs. Dorothy did not let her pass with it;
for all the time of drinking tea, she spoke of the precedency of
family, and the disparity there is between people who are come of
something and your mushroom gentry who wear their coats of arms
in their purses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her indignation was interrupted by the arrival of her maid
with a damask table-cloth, and a set of napkins, from the loom,
which had been spun by her mistress&rsquo;s own hand.&nbsp; There
was the family crest in each corner, and in the middle a view of
the battle of Worcester, where one of her ancestors had been a
captain in the king&rsquo;s forces; and with a sort of poetical
licence in perspective, there was seen the Royal Oak, with more
wig than leaves upon it.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>On
all this the good lady was very copious, and took up the
remaining intervals of filling tea, to describe its excellencies
to Harley; adding, that she intended this as a present for his
wife, when he should get one.&nbsp; He sighed and looked foolish,
and commending the serenity of the day, walked out into the
garden.</p>
<p>He sat down on a little seat which commanded an extensive
prospect round the house.&nbsp; He leaned on his hand, and scored
the ground with his stick: &ldquo;Miss Walton married!&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;but what is that to me?&nbsp; May she be happy!
her virtues deserve it; to me her marriage is otherwise
indifferent: I had romantic dreams? they are fled?&mdash;it is
perfectly indifferent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment he saw a servant with a knot of ribbons in
his hat go into the house.&nbsp; His cheeks grew flushed at the
sight!&nbsp; He kept his eye fixed for some time on the door by
which he had entered, then starting to his feet, hastily followed
him.</p>
<p>When he approached the door of the kitchen where he supposed
the man had entered, his heart throbbed so violently, that when
he would have called Peter, his voice failed in the
attempt.&nbsp; He <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>stood a moment listening in this breathless state of
palpitation: Peter came out by chance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did your
honour want any thing?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Where is the servant
that came just now from Mr.
Walton&rsquo;s?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;From Mr. Walton&rsquo;s, sir!
there is none of his servants here that I know
of.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nor of Sir Harry
Benson&rsquo;s?&rdquo;&mdash;He did not wait for an answer; but
having by this time observed the hat with its parti-coloured
ornament hanging on a peg near the door, he pressed forwards into
the kitchen, and addressing himself to a stranger whom he saw
there, asked him, with no small tremor in his voice, &ldquo;If he
had any commands for him?&rdquo;&nbsp; The man looked silly, and
said, &ldquo;That he had nothing to trouble his honour
with.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Are not you a servant of Sir Harry
Benson&rsquo;s?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No,
sir.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pardon me, young man; I
judged by the favour in your hat.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Sir,
I&rsquo;m his majesty&rsquo;s servant, God bless him! and these
favours we always wear when we are
recruiting.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Recruiting!&rdquo; his eyes
glistened at the word: he seized the soldier&rsquo;s hand, and
shaking it violently, ordered Peter to fetch a bottle of his
aunt&rsquo;s best dram.&nbsp; The bottle was brought: &ldquo;You
shall drink the king&rsquo;s health,&rdquo; said Harley,
&ldquo;in a bumper.&rdquo;&mdash;<a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>&ldquo;The king and your
honour.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nay, you shall drink the king&rsquo;s
health by itself; you may drink mine in another.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Peter looked in his master&rsquo;s face, and filled with some
little reluctance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now to your mistress,&rdquo; said
Harley; &ldquo;every soldier has a mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man
excused himself&mdash;&ldquo;To your mistress! you cannot refuse
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas Mrs. Margery&rsquo;s best
dram!&nbsp; Peter stood with the bottle a little inclined, but
not so as to discharge a drop of its contents: &ldquo;Fill it,
Peter,&rdquo; said his master, &ldquo;fill it to the
brim.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter filled it; and the soldier having named
Suky Simpson, dispatched it in a twinkling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art
an honest fellow,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;and I love
thee;&rdquo; and shaking his hand again, desired Peter to make
him his guest at dinner, and walked up into his room with a pace
much quicker and more springy than usual.</p>
<p>This agreeable disappointment, however, he was not long
suffered to enjoy.&nbsp; The curate happened that day to dine
with him: his visits, indeed, were more properly to the aunt than
the nephew; and many of the intelligent ladies in the parish,
who, like some very great philosophers, have the happy knack at
accounting for everything, gave out that there was a particular
attachment between them, <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>which wanted only to be matured by
some more years of courtship to end in the tenderest
connection.&nbsp; In this conclusion, indeed, supposing the
premises to have been true, they were somewhat justified by the
known opinion of the lady, who frequently declared herself a
friend to the ceremonial of former times, when a lover might have
sighed seven years at his mistress&rsquo;s feet before he was
allowed the liberty of kissing her hand.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true
Mrs. Margery was now about her grand climacteric; no matter: that
is just the age when we expect to grow younger.&nbsp; But I
verily believe there was nothing in the report; the
curate&rsquo;s connection was only that of a genealogist; for in
that character he was no way inferior to Mrs. Margery
herself.&nbsp; He dealt also in the present times; for he was a
politician and a news-monger.</p>
<p>He had hardly said grace after dinner, when he told Mrs.
Margery that she might soon expect a pair of white gloves, as Sir
Harry Benson, he was very well informed, was just going to be
married to Miss Walton.&nbsp; Harley spilt the wine he was
carrying to his mouth: he had time, however, to recollect himself
before the curate had finished the <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>different particulars of his
intelligence, and summing up all the heroism he was master of,
filled a bumper, and drank to Miss Walton.&nbsp; &ldquo;With all
my heart,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;the bride that is to
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Harley would have said bride too; but the word
bride stuck in his throat.&nbsp; His confusion, indeed, was
manifest; but the curate began to enter on some point of descent
with Mrs. Margery, and Harley had very soon after an opportunity
of leaving them, while they were deeply engaged in a question,
whether the name of some great man in the time of Henry the
Seventh was Richard or Humphrey.</p>
<p>He did not see his aunt again till supper; the time between he
spent in walking, like some troubled ghost, round the place where
his treasure lay.&nbsp; He went as far as a little gate, that led
into a copse near Mr. Walton&rsquo;s house, to which that
gentleman had been so obliging as to let him have a key.&nbsp; He
had just begun to open it when he saw, on a terrace below, Miss
Walton walking with a gentleman in a riding-dress, whom he
immediately guessed to be Sir Harry Benson.&nbsp; He stopped of a
sudden; his hand shook so much that he could hardly turn the key;
he opened the <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>gate, however, and advanced a few paces.&nbsp; The
lady&rsquo;s lap-dog pricked up its ears, and barked; he stopped
again&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;The little dogs and all,<br />
Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see they bark at me!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His resolution failed; he slunk back, and, locking the gate as
softly as he could, stood on tiptoe looking over the wall till
they were gone.&nbsp; At that instant a shepherd blew his horn:
the romantic melancholy of the sound quite overcame him!&mdash;it
was the very note that wanted to be touched&mdash;he sighed! he
dropped a tear!&mdash;and returned.</p>
<p>At supper his aunt observed that he was graver than usual; but
she did not suspect the cause: indeed, it may seem odd that she
was the only person in the family who had no suspicion of his
attachment to Miss Walton.&nbsp; It was frequently matter of
discourse amongst the servants: perhaps her maiden
coldness&mdash;but for those things we need not account.</p>
<p>In a day or two he was so much master of himself as to be able
to rhyme upon the subject.&nbsp; The following pastoral he left,
some time after, on <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>the handle of a tea-kettle, at a
neighbouring house where we were visiting; and as I filled the
tea-pot after him, I happened to put it in my pocket by a similar
act of forgetfulness.&nbsp; It is such as might be expected from
a man who makes verses for amusement.&nbsp; I am pleased with
somewhat of good nature that runs through it, because I have
commonly observed the writers of those complaints to bestow
epithets on their lost mistresses rather too harsh for the mere
liberty of choice, which led them to prefer another to the poet
himself: I do not doubt the vehemence of their passion; but,
alas! the sensations of love are something more than the returns
of gratitude.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; To banish my cares with the sound.</p>
<p>Erewhile were its notes of accord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the smile of the flow&rsquo;r-footed Muse;<br

Ah! why by its master implored<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shou&rsquo;d it now the gay carrol refuse?</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas taught by <span

&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mirth-loving chorus to join:<br />
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Ah, me!
how unweeting the while!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lavinia</span>&mdash;can never

<p>Another, more happy, the maid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By fortune is destin&rsquo;d to bless&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tho&rsquo; the hope has forsook that betray&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet why should I love her the less?</p>
<p>Her beauties are bright as the morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With rapture I counted them o&rsquo;er;<br />
Such virtues these beauties adorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew her, and prais&rsquo;d them no more.</p>
<p>I term&rsquo;d her no goddess of love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I call&rsquo;d not her beauty divine:<br />
These far other passions may prove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they could not be figures of mine.</p>
<p>It ne&rsquo;er was apparel&rsquo;d with art,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On words it could never rely;<br />
It reign&rsquo;d in the throb of my heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It gleam&rsquo;d in the glance of my eye.</p>
<p>Oh fool! in the circle to shine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Fashion&rsquo;s gay daughters approve,<br />
You must speak as the fashions incline;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! are there fashions in love?</p>
<p>Yet sure they are simple who prize<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tongue that is smooth to deceive;<br />
Yet sure she had sense to despise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tinsel that folly may weave.</p>
<p>When I talk&rsquo;d, I have seen her recline,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With an aspect so pensively sweet,&mdash;<br />
Tho&rsquo; I spoke what the shepherds opine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A fop were ashamed to repeat.</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>She
is soft as the dew-drops that fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the lip of the sweet-scented pea;<br />
Perhaps when she smil&rsquo;d upon all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have thought that she smil&rsquo;d upon me.</p>
<p>But why of her charms should I tell?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah me! whom her charms have undone<br />
Yet I love the reflection too well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The painful reflection to shun.</p>
<p>Ye souls of more delicate kind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who feast not on pleasure alone,<br />
Who wear the soft sense of the mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the sons of the world still unknown.</p>
<p>Ye know, tho&rsquo; I cannot express,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why I foolishly doat on my pain;<br />
Nor will ye believe it the less,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I have not the skill to complain.</p>
<p>I lean on my hand with a sigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My friends the soft sadness condemn;<br />
Yet, methinks, tho&rsquo; I cannot tell why,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I should hate to be merry like them.</p>
<p>When I walk&rsquo;d in the pride of the dawn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Methought all the region look&rsquo;d bright:<br />
Has sweetness forsaken the lawn?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For, methinks, I grow sad at the sight.</p>
<p>When I stood by the stream, I have thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There was mirth in the gurgling soft sound;<br />
But now &rsquo;tis a sorrowful note,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the banks are all gloomy around!</p>
<p>I have laugh&rsquo;d at the jest of a friend;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now they laugh, and I know not the cause,<br />
<a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>Tho&rsquo; I seem with my looks to attend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How silly!&nbsp; I ask what it was.</p>
<p>They sing the sweet song of the May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They sing it with mirth and with glee;<br />
Sure I once thought the sonnet was gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But now &rsquo;tis all sadness to me.</p>
<p>Oh! give me the dubious light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That gleams thro&rsquo; the quivering shade;<br />
Oh! give me the horrors of night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By gloom and by silence array&rsquo;d!</p>
<p>Let me walk where the soft-rising wave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has pictur&rsquo;d the moon on its breast;<br />
Let me walk where the new cover&rsquo;d grave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows the pale lover to rest!</p>
<p>When shall I in its peaceable womb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be laid with my sorrows asleep?<br />
Should <span class="smcap">Lavinia</span> but chance on my
tomb&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I could die if I thought she would weep.</p>
<p>Perhaps, if the souls of the just<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Revisit these mansions of care,<br />
It may be my favourite trust<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To watch o&rsquo;er the fate of the fair.</p>
<p>Perhaps the soft thought of her breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With rapture more favour&rsquo;d to warm;<br />
Perhaps, if with sorrow oppress&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sorrow with patience to arm.</p>
<p>Then, then, in the tenderest part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May I whisper, &ldquo;Poor <span

And mark if a heave of her heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The thought of her <span class="smcap">Colin</span>
pursue.</p>

PUPIL.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A FRAGMENT.</span></h3>
<p>* * * &ldquo;<span class="smcap">But</span> as to the higher
part of education, Mr. Harley, the culture of the mind&mdash;let
the feelings be awakened, let the heart be brought forth to its
object, placed in the light in which nature would have it stand,
and its decisions will ever be just.&nbsp; The world</p>
<blockquote><p>Will smile, and smile, and be a villain;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the youth, who does not suspect its deceit, will be
content to smile with it.&nbsp; Men will put on the most
forbidding aspect in nature, and tell him of the beauty of
virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not, under these grey hairs, forgotten that I
was once a young man, warm in the pursuit of pleasure, but
meaning to be honest as well as happy.&nbsp; I had ideas of
virtue, of honour, of benevolence, which I had never been at the
pains to define; but I felt my bosom heave at the thoughts of
them, and I made the most delightful soliloquies.&nbsp; It is
impossible, said I, that there can be half so many rogues as are
imagined.</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;I travelled, because it is the fashion for young
men of my fortune to travel.&nbsp; I had a travelling tutor,
which is the fashion too; but my tutor was a gentleman, which it
is not always the fashion for tutors to be.&nbsp; His gentility,
indeed, was all he had from his father, whose prodigality had not
left him a shilling to support it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have a favour to ask of you, my dear
Mountford,&rsquo; said my father, &lsquo;which I will not be
refused.&nbsp; You have travelled as became a man; neither France
nor Italy have made anything of Mountford, which Mountford,
before he left England, would have been ashamed of.&nbsp; My son
Edward goes abroad, would you take him under your
protection?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He blushed; my father&rsquo;s face was scarlet.&nbsp;
He pressed his hand to his bosom, as if he had said, my heart
does not mean to offend you.&nbsp; Mountford sighed twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am a proud fool,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and
you will pardon it.&nbsp; There! (he sighed again) I can hear of
dependance, since it is dependance on my Sedley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dependance!&rsquo; answered my father;
&lsquo;there can be no such word between us.&nbsp; What is there
<a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>in
&pound;9,000 a year that should make me unworthy of
Mountford&rsquo;s friendship?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They embraced; and soon after I set out on my travels,
with Mountford for my guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were at Milan, where my father happened to have an
Italian friend, to whom he had been of some service in
England.&nbsp; The count, for he was of quality, was solicitous
to return the obligation by a particular attention to his
son.&nbsp; We lived in his palace, visited with his family, were
caressed by his friends, and I began to be so well pleased with
my entertainment, that I thought of England as of some foreign
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The count had a son not much older than myself.&nbsp;
At that age a friend is an easy acquisition; we were friends the
first night of our acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He introduced me into the company of a set of young
gentlemen, whose fortunes gave them the command of pleasure, and
whose inclinations incited them to the purchase.&nbsp; After
having spent some joyous evenings in their society, it became a
sort of habit which I could not miss without uneasiness, and our
meetings, which before were frequent, were now stated and
regular.</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;Sometimes, in the pauses of our mirth, gaming
was introduced as an amusement.&nbsp; It was an art in which I
was a novice.&nbsp; I received instruction, as other novices do,
by losing pretty largely to my teachers.&nbsp; Nor was this the
only evil which Mountford foresaw would arise from the connection
I had formed; but a lecture of sour injunctions was not his
method of reclaiming.&nbsp; He sometimes asked me questions about
the company, but they were such as the curiosity of any
indifferent man might have prompted.&nbsp; I told him of their
wit, their eloquence, their warmth of friendship, and their
sensibility of heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;And their honour,&rsquo; said
I, laying my hand on my breast, &lsquo;is
unquestionable.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mountford seemed to rejoice at my
good fortune, and begged that I would introduce him to their
acquaintance.&nbsp; At the next meeting I introduced him
accordingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conversation was as animated as usual.&nbsp; They
displayed all that sprightliness and good-humour which my praises
had led Mountford to expect; subjects, too, of sentiment
occurred, and their speeches, particularly those of our friend
the son of Count Respino, glowed with the warmth of honour, and
softened into the tenderness <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>of feeling.&nbsp; Mountford was
charmed with his companions.&nbsp; When we parted, he made the
highest eulogiums upon them.&nbsp; &lsquo;When shall we see them
again?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; I was delighted with the demand, and
promised to reconduct him on the morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In going to their place of rendezvous, he took me a
little out of the road, to see, as he told me, the performances
of a young statuary.&nbsp; When we were near the house in which
Mountford said he lived, a boy of about seven years old crossed
us in the street.&nbsp; At sight of Mountford he stopped, and
grasping his hand,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dearest sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;my father
is likely to do well.&nbsp; He will live to pray for you, and to
bless you.&nbsp; Yes, he will bless you, though you are an
Englishman, and some other hard word that the monk talked of this
morning, which I have forgot, but it meant that you should not go
to heaven; but he shall go to heaven, said I, for he has saved my
father.&nbsp; Come and see him, sir, that we may be
happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear, I am engaged at present with this
gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But he shall come along with you; he is an <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>Englishman,
too, I fancy.&nbsp; He shall come and learn how an Englishman may
go to heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mountford smiled, and we followed the boy together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After crossing the next street, we arrived at the gate
of a prison.&nbsp; I <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>seemed surprised at the sight; our
little conductor observed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you afraid, sir?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was afraid once too, but my father and mother are here,
and I am never afraid when I am with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took my hand, and led me through a dark passage that
fronted the gate.&nbsp; When we came to a little door at the end,
he tapped.&nbsp; A boy, still younger than himself, opened it to
receive us.&nbsp; Mountford entered with a look in which was
pictured the benign assurance of a superior being.&nbsp; I
followed in silence and amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On something like a bed, lay a man, with a face
seemingly emaciated with sickness, and a look of patient
dejection.&nbsp; A bundle of dirty shreds served him for a
pillow, but he had a better support&mdash;the arm of a female who
kneeled beside him, beautiful as an angel, but with a fading
languor in her countenance, the still life of melancholy, that
seemed to borrow its shade from the object on which she
gazed.&nbsp; There was a tear in her eye&mdash;the sick man
kissed it off in its bud, smiling through the dimness of his
own&mdash;when she saw Mountford, she crawled forward on the
ground, and clasped his knees.&nbsp; He raised her from the
floor; she threw her arms round his neck, and sobbed out a speech
of thankfulness, eloquent beyond the power of language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Compose yourself, my love,&rsquo; said the man
on the bed; &lsquo;but he, whose goodness has caused that
emotion, will pardon its effects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How is this, Mountford?&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;what do I see?&nbsp; What must I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; replied the stranger, &lsquo;a
wretch, sunk in poverty, starving in prison, stretched on a sick
bed.&nbsp; But that is little.&nbsp; There are his wife and
children wanting the bread which he has not to give them!&nbsp;
Yet you cannot easily imagine the conscious serenity of his
mind.&nbsp; In the gripe of affliction, his heart swells with the
pride of virtue; it can even look down with pity on the man whose
cruelty has wrung it almost to bursting.&nbsp; You are, I fancy,
a friend of Mr. Mountford&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Come nearer, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you, for, short as my story is, <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>I can
hardly command breath enough for a recital.&nbsp; The son of
Count Respino (I started, as if I had trod on a viper) has long
had a criminal passion for my wife.&nbsp; This her prudence had
concealed from me; but he had lately the boldness to declare it
to myself.&nbsp; He promised me affluence in exchange for honour,
and threatened misery as its attendant if I kept it.&nbsp; I
treated him with the contempt he deserved; the consequence was,
that he hired a couple of bravoes (for I am persuaded they acted
under his direction), who attempted to assassinate me in the
street; but I made such a defence as obliged them to fly, after
having given me two or three stabs, none of which, however, were
mortal.&nbsp; But his revenge was not thus to be
disappointed.&nbsp; In the little dealings of my trade I had
contracted some debts, of which he had made himself master for my
ruin.&nbsp; I was confined here at his suit, when not yet
recovered from the wounds I had received; the dear woman, and
these two boys, followed me, that we might starve together; but
Providence interposed, and sent Mr. Mountford to our
support.&nbsp; He has relieved my family from the gnawings of
hunger, and rescued me from death, to which a fever, consequent
on my wounds and <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>increased by the want of every necessary, had almost
reduced me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Inhuman villain!&rsquo; I exclaimed, lifting up
my eyes to heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Inhuman indeed!&rsquo; said the lovely woman who
stood at my side.&nbsp; &lsquo;Alas! sir, what had we done to
offend him? what had these little ones done, that they should
perish in the toils of his vengeance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reached a pen which stood in the inkstand dish at the
bed-side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May I ask what is the amount of the sum for
which you are imprisoned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was able,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;to pay all
but five hundred crowns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote a draft on the banker with whom I had a credit
from my father for 2,500, and presenting it to the
stranger&rsquo;s wife,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will receive, madam, on presenting this
note, a sum more than sufficient for your husband&rsquo;s
discharge; the remainder I leave for his industry to
improve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have left the room.&nbsp; Each of them laid
hold of one of my hands, the children clung to my coat.&nbsp; Oh!
Mr. Harley, methinks I feel their <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>gentle violence at this moment; it
beats here with delight inexpressible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stay, sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I do not mean
attempting to thank you&rsquo; (he took a pocket-book from under
his pillow), &lsquo;let me but know what name I shall place here
next to Mr. Mountford!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sedley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He writ it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An Englishman too, I presume.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He shall go to heaven, notwithstanding;&rsquo;
said the boy who had been our guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It began to be too much for me.&nbsp; I squeezed his
hand that was clasped in mine, his wife&rsquo;s I pressed to my
lips, and burst from the place, to give vent to the feelings that
laboured within me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Mountford!&rsquo; said I, when he had
overtaken me at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is time,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;that we
should think of our appointment; young Respino and his friends
are waiting us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Damn him, damn him!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let us leave Milan instantly; but soft&mdash;I will be
calm; Mountford, your pencil.&rsquo;&nbsp; I wrote on a slip of
paper,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;To Signor <span
class="smcap">Respino</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When you receive this, I am at a distance from
Milan.&nbsp; Accept of my thanks for the civilities I have
received from you and your family.&nbsp; As to the friendship
with which you were pleased to honour me, the prison, which I
have just left, has exhibited a scene to cancel it for
ever.&nbsp; You may possibly be merry with your companions at my
weakness, as I suppose you will term it.&nbsp; I give you leave
for derision.&nbsp; You may affect a triumph, I shall feel
it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Edward
Sedley</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You may send this if you will,&rsquo; said
Mountford, coolly, &lsquo;but still Respino is a <i>man of
honour</i>; the world will continue to call him so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is probable,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;they
may; I envy not the appellation.&nbsp; If this is the
world&rsquo;s honour, if these men are the guides of its
manners&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tut!&rsquo; said Mountford, &lsquo;do you eat
macaroni&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>[At this place had the greatest depredations of the curate
begun.&nbsp; There were so very few connected <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>passages of
the subsequent chapters remaining, that even the partiality of an
editor could not offer them to the public.&nbsp; I discovered,
from some scattered sentences, that they were of much the same
tenor with the preceding; recitals of little adventures, in which
the dispositions of a man, sensible to judge, and still more warm
to feel, had room to unfold themselves.&nbsp; Some instruction,
and some example, I make no doubt they contained; but it is
likely that many of those, whom chance has led to a perusal of
what I have already presented, may have read it with little
pleasure, and will feel no disappointment from the want of those
parts which I have been unable to procure.&nbsp; To such as may
have expected the intricacies of a novel, a few incidents in a
life undistinguished, except by some features of the heart,
cannot have afforded much entertainment.</p>
<p>Harley&rsquo;s own story, from the mutilated passages I have
mentioned, as well as from some inquiries I was at the trouble of
making in the country, I found to have been simple to
excess.&nbsp; His mistress, I could perceive, was not married to
Sir Harry Benson; but it would seem, by one of the following
chapters, which is still entire, that Harley had not <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>profited on
the occasion by making any declaration of his own passion, after
those of the other had been unsuccessful.&nbsp; The state of his
health, for some part of this period, appears to have been such
as to forbid any thoughts of that kind: he had been seized with a
very dangerous fever, caught by attending old Edwards in one of
an infectious kind.&nbsp; From this he had recovered but
imperfectly, and though he had no formed complaint, his health
was manifestly on the decline.</p>
<p>It appears that the sagacity of some friend had at length
pointed out to his aunt a cause from which this might be supposed
to proceed, to wit, his hopeless love for Miss Walton; for,
according to the conceptions of the world, the love of a man of
Harley&rsquo;s fortune for the heiress of &pound;4,000 a year is
indeed desperate.&nbsp; Whether it was so in this case may be
gathered from the next chapter, which, with the two subsequent,
concluding the performance, have escaped those accidents that
proved fatal to the rest.]</p>
<h2><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>CHAPTER LV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HE SEES MISS WALTON, AND IS
HAPPY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Harley</span> was one of those few friends
whom the malevolence of fortune had yet left me; I could not
therefore but be sensibly concerned for his present
indisposition; there seldom passed a day on which I did not make
inquiry about him.</p>
<p>The physician who attended him had informed me the evening
before, that he thought him considerably better than he had been
for some time past.&nbsp; I called next morning to be confirmed
in a piece of intelligence so welcome to me.</p>
<p>When I entered his apartment, I found him sitting on a couch,
leaning on his hand, with his eye turned upwards in the attitude
of thoughtful inspiration.&nbsp; His look had always an open
benignity, which commanded esteem; there was now something
more&mdash;a gentle triumph in it.</p>
<p>He rose, and met me with his usual kindness.&nbsp; When I gave
him the good accounts I had had from his physician, &ldquo;I am
foolish enough,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to rely but little, in
this instance, upon physic: my <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>presentiment may be false; but I
think I feel myself approaching to my end, by steps so easy, that
they woo me to approach it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a certain dignity in retiring from life at a
time, when the infirmities of age have not sapped our
faculties.&nbsp; This world, my dear Charles, was a scene in
which I never much delighted.&nbsp; I was not formed for the
bustle of the busy, nor the dissipation of the gay; a thousand
things occurred, where I blushed for the impropriety of my
conduct when I thought on the world, though my reason told me I
should have blushed to have done otherwise.&mdash;It was a scene
of dissimulation, of restraint, of disappointment.&nbsp; I leave
it to enter on that state which I have learned to believe is
replete with the genuine happiness attendant upon virtue.&nbsp; I
look back on the tenor of my life, with the consciousness of few
great offences to account for.&nbsp; There are blemishes, I
confess, which deform in some degree the picture.&nbsp; But I
know the benignity of the Supreme Being, and rejoice at the
thoughts of its exertion in my favour.&nbsp; My mind expands at
the thought I shall enter into the society of the blessed, wise
as angels, with the simplicity of children.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
by this time clasped my hand, and found <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>it wet by a
tear which had just fallen upon it.&mdash;His eye began to
moisten too&mdash;we sat for some time silent.&mdash;At last,
with an attempt to a look of more composure, &ldquo;There are
some remembrances,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;which rise
involuntary on my heart, and make me almost wish to live.&nbsp; I
have been blessed with a few friends, who redeem my opinion of
mankind.&nbsp; I recollect, with the tenderest emotion, the
scenes of pleasure I have passed among them; but we shall meet
again, my friend, never to be separated.&nbsp; There are some
feelings which perhaps are too tender to be suffered by the
world.&mdash;The world is in general selfish, interested, and
unthinking, and throws the imputation of romance or melancholy on
every temper more susceptible than its own.&nbsp; I cannot think
but in those regions which I contemplate, if there is any thing
of mortality left about us, that these feelings will
subsist;&mdash;they are called,&mdash;perhaps they
are&mdash;weaknesses here;&mdash;but there may be some better
modifications of them in heaven, which may deserve the name of
virtues.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sighed as he spoke these last
words.&nbsp; He had scarcely finished them, when the door opened,
and his aunt appeared, leading in Miss Walton.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;here is Miss Walton, <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>who has
been so kind as to come and inquire for you herself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I could observe a transient glow upon his face.&nbsp; He rose
from his seat&mdash;&ldquo;If to know Miss Walton&rsquo;s
goodness,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;be a title to deserve it, I have
some claim.&rdquo;&nbsp; She begged him to resume his seat, and
placed herself on the sofa beside him.&nbsp; I took my
leave.&nbsp; Mrs. Margery accompanied me to the door.&nbsp; He
was left with Miss Walton alone.&nbsp; She inquired anxiously
about his health.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;from the accounts which my physicians unwillingly give me,
that they have no great hopes of my recovery.&rdquo;&mdash;She
started as he spoke; but recollecting herself immediately,
endeavoured to flatter him into a belief that his apprehensions
were groundless.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
it is usual with persons at my time of life to have these hopes,
which your kindness suggests; but I would not wish to be
deceived.&nbsp; To meet death as becomes a man, is a privilege
bestowed on few.&mdash;I would endeavour to make it
mine;&mdash;nor do I think that I can ever be better prepared for
it than now:&mdash;It is that chiefly which determines the
fitness of its approach.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Those
sentiments,&rdquo; answered Miss Walton, &ldquo;are just; but
your good sense, Mr. Harley, will own, that life has its proper
<a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>value.&mdash;As the province of virtue, life is
ennobled; as such, it is to be desired.&mdash;To virtue has the
Supreme Director of all things assigned rewards enough even here
to fix its attachment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject began to overpower her.&mdash;Harley lifted his
eyes from the ground&mdash;&ldquo;There are,&rdquo; said he, in a
very low voice, &ldquo;there are attachments, Miss
Walton&rdquo;&mdash;His glance met hers.&mdash;They both betrayed
a confusion, and were both instantly withdrawn.&mdash;He paused
some moments&mdash;&ldquo;I am such a state as calls for
sincerity, let that also excuse it&mdash;It is perhaps the last
time we shall ever meet.&nbsp; I feel something particularly
solemn in the acknowledgment, yet my heart swells to make it,
awed as it is by a sense of my presumption, by a sense of your
perfections&rdquo;&mdash;He paused again&mdash;&ldquo;Let it not
offend you, to know their power over one so unworthy&mdash;It
will, I believe, soon cease to beat, even with that feeling which
it shall lose the latest.&mdash;To love Miss Walton could not be
a crime;&mdash;if to declare it is one&mdash;the expiation will
be made.&rdquo;&mdash;Her tears were now flowing without
control.&mdash;&ldquo;Let me intreat you,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;to have better hopes&mdash;Let not life be so indifferent
to you; if my wishes can put any value on it&mdash;I will not <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>pretend to
misunderstand you&mdash;I know your worth&mdash;I have known it
long&mdash;I have esteemed it&mdash;What would you have me
say?&mdash;I have loved it as it deserved.&rdquo;&mdash;He seized
her hand&mdash;a languid colour reddened his cheek&mdash;a smile
brightened faintly in his eye.&nbsp; As he gazed on her, it grew
dim, it fixed, it closed&mdash;He sighed and fell back on his
seat&mdash;Miss Walton screamed at the sight&mdash;His aunt and
the servants rushed into the room&mdash;They found them lying
motionless together.&mdash;His physician happened to call at that
instant.&nbsp; Every art was tried to recover them&mdash;With
Miss Walton they succeeded&mdash;But Harley was gone for
ever.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LVI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE EMOTIONS OF THE HEART.</span></h2>
<p>I entered the room where his body lay; I approached it with
reverence, not fear: I looked; the recollection of the past
crowded upon me.&nbsp; I saw that form which, but a little
before, was animated with a soul which did honour to humanity,
stretched without <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>sense or feeling before me.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
connection we cannot easily forget:&mdash;I took his hand in
mine; I repeated his name involuntary;&mdash;I felt a pulse in
every vein at the sound.&nbsp; I looked earnestly in his face;
his eye was closed, his lip pale and motionless.&nbsp; There is
an enthusiasm in sorrow that forgets impossibility; I wondered
that it was so.&nbsp; The sight drew a prayer from my heart: it
was the voice of frailty and of man! the confusion of my mind
began to subside into thought; I had time to meet!</p>
<p>I turned with the last farewell upon my lips, when I observed
old Edwards standing behind me.&nbsp; I looked him full in the
face; but his eye was fixed on another object: he pressed between
me and the bed, and stood gazing on the breathless remains of his
benefactor.&nbsp; I spoke to him I know not what; but he took no
notice of what I said, and remained in the same attitude as
before.&nbsp; He stood some minutes in that posture, then turned
and walked towards the door.&nbsp; He paused as he went;&mdash;he
returned a second time: I could observe his lips move as he
looked: but the voice they would have uttered was lost.&nbsp; He
attempted going again; and a third time he returned as
before.&mdash;I saw him wipe his <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>cheek: then covering his face with
his hands, his breast heaving with the most convulsive throbs, he
flung out of the room.</p>
<h2>THE CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> had hinted that he should like
to be buried in a certain spot near the grave of his
mother.&nbsp; This is a weakness; but it is universally incident
to humanity: &rsquo;tis at least a memorial for those who
survive: for some indeed a slender memorial will serve;&mdash;and
the soft affections, when they are busy that way, will build
their structures, were it but on the paring of a nail.</p>
<p>He was buried in the place he had desired.&nbsp; It was shaded
by an old tree, the only one in the church-yard, in which was a
cavity worn by time.&nbsp; I have sat with him in it, and counted
the tombs.&nbsp; The last time we passed there, methought he
looked wistfully on the tree: there was a branch of it that bent
towards us waving in the wind; he waved his hand as if he
mimicked its motion.&nbsp; There was something predictive in his
look! perhaps it is <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>foolish to remark it; but there are
times and places when I am a child at those things.</p>
<p>I sometimes visit his grave; I sit in the hollow of the
tree.&nbsp; It is worth a thousand homilies; every noble feeling
rises within me! every beat of my heart awakens a
virtue!&mdash;but it will make you hate the world&mdash;No: there
is such an air of gentleness around, that I can hate nothing;
but, as to the world&mdash;I pity the men of it.</p>

remember having shown this chapter to anybody, I strongly suspect
that these political observations are the work of a later pen

been, by some accident, a gap in the manuscript, from the words,
&ldquo;Expectation at a jointure,&rdquo; to these, &ldquo;In
short, man is an animal,&rdquo; where the present blank ends; and
some other person (for the hand is different, and the ink whiter)

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
